21:45:03 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Veena We will cover that exact question about Lists vs Tuples vs Dictionaries in the session today :)
21:45:29 From  [GL-Mentor] Bradford Tuckfield  to  Simon Timbillah gl and all panelists:
	https://colab.research.google.com/
21:46:03 From  [GL-Mentor] Bradford Tuckfield  to  Everyone:
	https://colab.research.google.com/
21:46:22 From  Shilpa Tyagi gl  to  Everyone:
	there is a bar between notebook screen and the teacher. You may drag it to the left to get a better view  of the notebook.
21:47:07 From  FABIANA P NOVELLO gl  to  Everyone:
	there is difference between quote and double quote for strings?
21:47:12 From  Vijay Goswami gl  to  Everyone:
	screen splitter
21:47:22 From  Vijay Goswami gl  to  Everyone:
	for the guy you wanted to maximize the screen
21:47:27 From  Jorge Marty gl  to  Everyone:
	the bar is for the participants... its a function in zoom
21:47:35 From  Suruthi Vinoth Kannan gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Will we use any IDE in particular for coding?
21:47:44 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	How do variables "store" data?
21:50:21 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	WOW
21:50:35 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Lucy: think about variables as pointers to objects that are stored in memory (heap). everything in Python is an object
21:51:11 From  Ramanan Kannan gl  to  Everyone:
	Are the lectures being recorded, can I access the videos again after class for reference?
21:51:16 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	Incredible. Thank you Brad and Rodrigo
21:51:18 From  Andy Mak gl  to  Everyone:
	Is there a way to display all the variables you have defined so far?
21:51:29 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Ramanan Yes, the session recording will be made available afterwards
21:51:31 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Fabiana - Single quotes and double quotes are used interchangeable in Python, as long as the starting and ending symbol for a particular string are consistent.
21:51:41 From  Nischal Basetty gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	will there be a situation , we need to clear up the memory occupied by the variables?
21:52:06 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Andy Mak: dir() should list your local environment
21:52:36 From  Prerna Mathur gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Is there a way to comment multiple lines?
21:52:47 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	How do i get to see the menu ..Mine is hidden for some reason
21:53:00 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	Menu as in File ...Run etc
21:53:03 From  Daniel Choi gl  to  Everyone:
	How do we define what information is outputted and which is not? Is there a symbol that we put at the end of a line?
21:53:17 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Nischal Definitely not in this program, and mostly never when you're doing Data Science in Python. There is a lot of memory made available, and in high-level programming languages like Python, you generally don't have to worry about manual memory management in any way
21:54:10 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Prerna The triple double-quotes """ can be used at the start and end to have a multi-line comment in between
21:54:37 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	I don't see the Run icon and other menu items
21:54:38 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	is an "initial order" the very first line of code sans comments
21:54:58 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	How do i get this added ?
21:55:12 From  Obrad Scepanovic gl  to  Everyone:
	click on up arrow
21:55:15 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	I don't see the Run icon
21:55:20 From  Daniel Choi gl  to  Everyone:
	If you run the code, will it run the entire notebook? Or just the block that is selected?
21:55:21 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	or the Menu
21:55:26 From  Kuldeep Rawat gl  to  Everyone:
	You can add the cell by clicking + on top left
21:55:29 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	just the selected block
21:55:30 From  Venkata Suneel Dasika gl  to  Everyone:
	shift enter shortcut to run
21:55:39 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	you can re-run the selected block and it appends this code
21:55:41 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	Don't you see my question ?
21:55:52 From  Ozlem Polat gl  to  Everyone:
	when do we use indents?
21:55:54 From  Yevette J West gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Is there a shortcut to execute your code instead of clicking on 'Run' to execute?
21:55:55 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	I am unable to see the command menu
21:56:06 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Harish, type Shift+Enter and it will execute the selected cell
21:56:15 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Hariish I am unsure how to help you, I don't know why you don't have access
21:56:16 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	I know that
21:56:22 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	I want to see the Menu
21:56:28 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	How do i add that >
21:56:30 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	HArish: The menu should be always visible. Try reloading the page
21:56:50 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Daniel - We use the print() function to display a particular variable. By default, Jupyter displays the output of the last line of code if no print() function is used.
21:57:02 From  Govinda Villasa Lopez Garza gl  to  Everyone:
	is there a difference between:
21:57:09 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	Did not work ..I am still unable to see the Menu --File Run etc
21:57:19 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	why not use an f string for this?
21:57:20 From  Sham kumar Sankar gl  to  Everyone:
	Hey Brad, Its hard to follow along if you randomly answer questions,  I would request to  keep going with your planned flow and then dedicate some time after 30 mins for example to answer questions
21:57:38 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Harish: Are you running "jupyter notebook" from the shell?
21:57:43 From  Govinda Villasa Lopez Garza gl  to  Everyone:
	is there a difference between: my_variable+=3 and my_variable=+3
21:58:00 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	Yes I am using a Jupyter notebook from Anaconda
21:58:02 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Govinda isn't one of them going to fail?
21:58:06 From  Sara Rahme gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	+1 Sham
21:58:31 From  Adam Stacey gl  to  Everyone:
	use the first to add 3, I think the second would error
21:58:37 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Harish: could you try another borwser?
21:58:44 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	v+=1 is shorthand for v = v+1
21:58:45 From  Govinda Villasa Lopez Garza gl  to  Everyone:
	not sure, in some languages it adds the number first to the variable, then in the second case it adds the values then saves it to the variable
21:59:26 From  Govinda Villasa Lopez Garza gl  to  Everyone:
	thanks for clarifying
21:59:28 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Govinda The first adds 3 to my_variable's value. The second merely initializes my_variable with 3 (+3 is just 3 in Python).
21:59:31 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	I know you can use both var == True and var is True. Is there a difference between these two?
21:59:37 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Govinda += is a single self-increment operator, whereas = + are the attribution   operator and the unitary plus operator
21:59:47 From  Govinda Villasa Lopez Garza gl  to  Everyone:
	thanks
21:59:48 From  Robert D. Hill gl  to  Everyone:
	double equal sign?
21:59:56 From  Beverly Hughes gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	I agree to a previous comment, please stick to the material and then answer questions (the material may answer some of the questions).  I do appreciate the effort to be interactive, but it's a lot to cover in 1.5 hours.
22:00:07 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	double equals so that you don't assign a value to the variable with a single equals
22:00:16 From  Glendon Brown gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	why the double =
22:00:23 From  Glendon Brown gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	already answered, darn
22:00:25 From  James McGuire gl  to  Everyone:
	== checks if two values are the same
22:00:30 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	Did not work i will google the solution i guess
22:00:39 From  Pratik Das gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Is there a way to mute chat? too distracting
22:00:39 From  FABIANA P NOVELLO gl  to  Everyone:
	there is a "case" statement in pyton?  to avoid this kind of "if else" structure
22:00:44 From  Craig Munnik gl  to  Everyone:
	Brad, does python have a CASE statement, or do you have to do if … elif statements?
22:00:46 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Yevette - The shortcut to run the code in Jupyter is Ctr+Enter.
22:01:16 From  Manjola Tabaku gl  to  Everyone:
	why does the input run slow, or frequently have to interrupt tro reload
22:01:27 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	match x:
	        case 'a':
	            return 1
	   
22:01:40 From  Dandan Kowarsch gl  to  Everyone:
	can use if if rather than if elif?
22:01:42 From  Yichun Chen gl  to  Everyone:
	does the capital matter  such as Phone?
22:01:52 From  Craig Munnik gl  to  Everyone:
	Thank you on the Case!!!
22:02:06 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Dandan if if would be used if the two options are not mutually exclusive. if elif is used when they are.
22:02:07 From  Govinda Villasa Lopez Garza gl  to  Everyone:
	can you do something like this: match x:
22:02:07 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	capital matters
22:02:26 From  SAURABH YASHWANT JOSHI gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	What did you do to interrupt kernel? Why you did that?
22:02:32 From  MIchael Caldwell gl  to  Everyone:
	is there an 'in' statement instead of ==?
22:02:33 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Yichun Yes, Python is very case-sensitive
22:02:49 From  Grace Brodbeck gl  to  Everyone:
	how can you account for spaces?
22:03:00 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	lowercase the thing and trim the spaces around the input
22:03:05 From  SAURABH YASHWANT JOSHI gl  to  Everyone:
	What did you do to interrupt kernel? Why you did that?
22:03:16 From  [GL-Mentor] Bradford Tuckfield  to  Everyone:
	regular expressions
22:03:21 From  ABDUL SYED gl  to  Everyone:
	can you use like?
22:03:35 From  Govinda Villasa Lopez Garza gl  to  Everyone:
	match x between 1 and 10:
		case ‘a’:
			return 1
22:03:39 From  Govinda Villasa Lopez Garza gl  to  Everyone:
	does that work?
22:03:41 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Govinda: Python 10 introduces structural pattern matching, see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/ (not regex, that python had forever in the re module)
22:04:00 From  Govinda Villasa Lopez Garza gl  to  Everyone:
	Error 404: File not Found
22:04:20 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/
22:04:56 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	don't use = to compare, unless you know what you're doing :P
22:05:10 From  Suruthi Vinoth Kannan gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Can you please give example for while condition and when to use it?
22:05:47 From  Yevette J West gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	TA's:  Is a copy of this notebook available for us to play with?
22:05:52 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	can u make your display full screen ? or bigger
22:06:06 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	Thank you
22:06:11 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	HArish: You can use zoom facility in the Zoom app
22:06:24 From  Oktay Selcuk gl  to  Everyone:
	Considering relatively big data, what is the element limitation for a LIST? (e.g.: 1 million?)
22:06:26 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	View Options -> Zoom ratio
22:06:34 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	Fixed link: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/
22:07:05 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Suruthi "while" is a looping keyword, you would use it to check if some condition is True; if it's False, a code block is executed and usually the value we're checking for is incremented in some way, such that eventually, the while condition becomes true and the loop is exited. The "for" loop is usually easier to control and more elegant than the "while" loop for data science purposes
22:07:06 From  Shilpa Tyagi gl  to  Everyone:
	Harish, there is a slider bar between the two screens shared. That would help you make the code screen bigger.
22:07:12 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Yevette - Yes, you can find all the content shown today, including the notebook and slides, in pre-work course.
22:07:49 From  Pooja Chopra gl  to  Everyone:
	Can we use append to combine/concatenate elements of two lists?
22:08:01 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	For larger screen, viewers can go to zoom, green bar at the top, View Options -> Zoom ratio and choose a magnifier level
22:08:05 From  Venkata Suneel Dasika gl  to  Everyone:
	we could simplify and code this way right: orderlist[0]
22:08:12 From  Yevette J West gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	@ Prateek.  I must have overlooked it.  I look again.  Thank you.
22:08:21 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@Oktay It depends on the system you are working on and the RAM it has.
22:08:29 From  Andy Mak gl  to  Everyone:
	Can you place multiple variables on a single output?
22:08:34 From  Andy Mak gl  to  Everyone:
	input
22:09:08 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Oktay There is no theoretical limit to how many values you can store in a list, the only constraints are memory and time required to add them into it. It's uncommon but not impossible to see lists with millions of values.
22:09:09 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Oktay if your data is massive, take a slice of the data and work on that, then take the next slice, etc.
22:09:10 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Pooja - The append function can only add one element at the end of the list. Two combine two lists, you can simply use the + operator.
22:09:25 From  Christopher Mahoney gl  to  Everyone:
	Why are you using the print function is you can just for index 1 using the brackets?
22:09:27 From  Ashwin Patha gl  to  Everyone:
	you can also use negative indexes
22:09:38 From  weijie yang gl  to  Everyone:
	0:3 but not including 3. something to remember
22:09:48 From  Isaac Flikier Zelkowicz gl  to  Everyone:
	Hi Brad! is there a function to automatically separate, say a sentence into a list o single word or any other kind of string into parts? or must you input them individually
22:10:00 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@Ashwin Yes. You can access List from the last by using negative index
22:10:04 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	Isn't tuple originally a pair of values?
22:10:23 From  MIchael Caldwell gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	good advice.  why would you need a tuple instead of a list?
22:10:35 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@Timo, Dict are key value pair
22:10:36 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Timo: No, Tuple can have any number of elements. Think of it as a immutable list after creation.
22:10:45 From  Craig Munnik gl  to  Everyone:
	use the .split() function to parse the sentence into separate words
22:10:45 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Isaac Yes, there are functions in Python for those operations. The split() function is one example, it can split any string using any separator you would like.
22:10:59 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Rodrigo, thanks, makes sense, I'm a fan of immutability
22:11:20 From  Anita Albert gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Is Dictionary much like json?
22:11:26 From  [GL-TA] Ajith  to  Everyone:
	@Timo Tuples are similar to lists but once created they are immutable
22:11:40 From  Venkateswara Sadu gl  to  Everyone:
	Is there a contains key in dictionary?
22:11:44 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	Thanks @Ajith
22:11:48 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@Anita Yes, similar to that. But Json can have nested Dict.
22:12:06 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Timo: Single element and empty tuples are trickier
	tuple(),  ('single element tuple',)
22:12:12 From  Yevette J West gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	TA's:  Will we be able to see the chat conversation in the recording?  Impossible to pay attention to the chat and the instructor.  Don't want to miss anything.
22:12:36 From  Craig Munnik gl  to  Everyone:
	is there a cheatsheet for when to use lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries?
22:12:39 From  Mohammad Ayub gl  to  Everyone:
	FYI: All of these topics are covered in Pre-Work videos.
22:12:54 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	can i print part of a list ?
22:12:54 From  Anita Albert gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	is the purpose of a Set to ‘clean’ a list to be only unique?
22:12:58 From  MIchael Caldwell gl  to  Everyone:
	so it basically automatically de-dups?  is that the main benefit?
22:13:03 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Yevette - No, the chat will not be visible in the recording.
22:13:08 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@venkateswara, yes, we have dict.key(), using which you can get keys
22:13:09 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Yevette We are separately tracking the questions on another sheet; we will also be releasing a Q&A sheet after the session so you can refer back to the questions asked in the session
22:13:29 From  Mukul Mondal  to  Everyone:
	How big can be a list?
22:13:36 From  Ashwin Patha gl  to  Everyone:
	@Harish you can print part of the list ex: list[0:3]
22:14:02 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Harish - Yes, you can use slicing to print a part of a list, for example list[0:3] to print the first 3 elements of the list.
22:14:06 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Anita Yes, that is one of the Set's most useful properties, it can definitely be used that way
22:14:09 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Mukul a list can be as big as your computer allows
22:14:24 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	Thanks
22:15:06 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@Craig, you can raise an Support ticked, the team will send you some resources on the cheetsheet.
22:15:22 From  Deepak Gaikwad gl  to  Everyone:
	do you need to use range() for list in for loop?
22:15:23 From  weijie yang gl  to  Everyone:
	instead of i, can I use other letters. I heard that i is kind of special
22:15:26 From  Will McGuire gl  to  Everyone:
	does it need to be "i" or can we use any ref we want that isn't already defined?
22:15:49 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Weijie Yes, you can use any variable name for that iterator. i is just a convention.
22:16:12 From  [GL-TA] Ajith  to  Everyone:
	@Weijie It is a variable and you can use anything of your choice
22:16:20 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Will Yes, the variable name is upto you
22:16:22 From  Robert D. Hill gl  to  Everyone:
	can you explain: \n at the end of the print lines
22:16:32 From  Myisha Boulware gl  to  Everyone:
	Does the Loop function always have to be ran with the 'else' function? or is it only mandatory when you need to break the statement?
22:16:41 From  Anita Albert gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Does ‘For’ implicitly work as foreach depending on the usage? And also you can use a counter?
22:16:54 From  Mark Braxton gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	\n prints new line
22:16:59 From  Mohammad Ayub gl  to  Everyone:
	\n means new lne
22:17:01 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Robert That's a newline character. It ensures that the next print statement prints on the next line and doesn't continue on the same line from the previous print statement.
22:17:07 From  Robert D. Hill gl  to  Everyone:
	thank you
22:17:13 From  Brian A Sakarata gl  to  Everyone:
	@deepak To my understanding, you have to use range(len(list[]))
22:17:26 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	so we are creating backend rules to run a business- got it. To operationalize we create all of these variables to define i.e. products, services, and offers...?
22:17:32 From  Daniel Choi gl  to  Everyone:
	Is there a certain command to end the for loop? Like an "end" command?
22:17:35 From  Mohammad Ayub gl  to  Everyone:
	\n means new line
22:17:46 From  Adam Stacey gl  to  Everyone:
	break
22:17:51 From  Simon Timbillah gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	what is the \n at the end of the print code
22:18:06 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	does == also signify "does not equal"
22:18:09 From  Xiwei Cao gl  to  Everyone:
	gl?
22:18:10 From  Brian A Sakarata gl  to  Everyone:
	len(list:[]) doesn't provide an iterable data type, but wrapping it in range() will.
22:18:11 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@Myisha, No it is not necessary. Just depend on the output you are trying to get.
22:18:18 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	!= is not equal to
22:18:27 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Anita Yes, in Python, the "for" loop is basically the "for each" of older programming languages. You don't need another explicit counter in a "for" loop for that reason.
22:18:31 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Daniel: in python indentation defines the lexical scope (no begin,end no {} for lexical scope)
22:18:37 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	af ok thanks Chris
22:18:44 From  [GL-TA] Ajith  to  Everyone:
	@Simon \n is used for starting a new line
22:19:20 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Daniel - The for loop will end after iterating over all the elements. You can use a break statement if you want the loop to end after some condition is fulfilled.
22:19:22 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Daniel No, the "for" loop only works on the range specified and exits automatically
22:19:30 From  Katherine Morgan gl  to  Everyone:
	Are the modules similar to installing R packages?
22:19:56 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Katherine Yes, similar to R, the packages are all open source and can easily be installed/imported
22:20:27 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	python is popular and used in this course, but you are free to do the same in anything else, like javascript
22:20:44 From  Craig Munnik gl  to  Everyone:
	is there a separate install required for these modules? For example, how does it know where to get pandas from?
22:21:21 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Craig: in standard python "pip3 install pandas"
22:21:21 From  Kuldeep Rawat gl  to  Everyone:
	@Craig: Anaconda installation will come with Pandas or other common modules
22:21:45 From  [GL-TA] Ajith  to  Everyone:
	@Craig  yes you can use the code using pip install
22:21:51 From  Kenneth L. Giden gl  to  Everyone:
	I assume the csv file must be in the same directory as the Jupiter notebook?
22:21:53 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@Craig, Pandas is pre installed in Anaconda and you need not to install.
22:22:27 From  Yevette J West gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Is there a way to turn off the chat pop-up feature?  I closed the chat window but chats keep popping up.
22:22:29 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	can I use PyCharm or should I follow through anaconda and jupyter?
22:22:47 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Kenneth Yes, if you're directly reading in "WOW.csv". Otherwise, it can be in anther directory too, you'll just have to provide that whole directory from the root inside the string, otherwise it'll not be able to find the file.
22:22:57 From  Anurag Mohapatra gl  to  Everyone:
	where is the WOW.csv stored. I dont see you specifying a location.
22:22:59 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Cris I think you're free to use whatever works for you, I'm using vscode
22:23:06 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	ok thanks
22:23:23 From  Victor Lara gl  to  Everyone:
	Is there a way to print all the data?
22:23:31 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Anyrag WOW is available to download on the great learning website, store it in the same folder as the jypiter file
22:24:17 From  Brian A Sakarata gl  to  Everyone:
	@Chris at least for the practice project and practice assignments, we have to submit the jupyter html, which will have the output and markup included.
22:24:31 From  Craig Munnik gl  to  Everyone:
	do you need to have the import pandas code in every jupyter notebook or do you just need to do it once and it will establish the library on your computer?
22:24:32 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Chris - In this course, we will be specifically be using Jupyter Notebooks for practice, projects, and other purposes, since the nature of the case studies and projects is that they are a combination of programming exercises and reporting assignments too.
22:24:47 From  Mohammad Ayub gl  to  Everyone:
	@Chris I use PyCharm. It works great, designed for it. Cool IDE.
22:25:03 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	ok fair enough:(
22:25:24 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Chris, or use both haha :)
22:25:25 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Craig Yes, the import code will need to be there in every notebook
22:25:38 From  Craig Munnik gl  to  Everyone:
	Thanks!
22:25:52 From  Anita Albert gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	I’m a programmer and Jupyter notebooks seemed really odd at first but is growing on me. I also use pycharm
22:28:14 From  Craig Munnik gl  to  Everyone:
	where did you define the layout of the file you used?
22:28:37 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	I think it sniffs the first row as the names for the columns @Craig
22:29:29 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	Yes, the file is a CSV, and in the pd.read_csv() function, the first row is assumed to be column names by default, unless otherwise specified
22:29:33 From  Mohammad Ayub gl  to  Everyone:
	Can you get intellisense in the Notebook?
22:29:48 From  Pratik Das gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	What is the best way to represent data? I am sure we will not open this editor in front of CEO? using tableau or power point?
22:30:13 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@Craig CSV are similar to tables in Excel. The first row in that table is considered as coumns.
22:30:17 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	columns*
22:30:39 From  Prerna Mathur gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Is there a particular location where we save the csv file.
22:30:57 From  Anita Albert gl  to  Everyone:
	with Jupiter not having intellisense, is this a good option:
22:31:00 From  Anita Albert gl  to  Everyone:
	But it’s quite easy to enable it. Just add this line at the top of your notebook
	
	%config IPCompleter.greedy=True
22:31:06 From  Suruthi Vinoth Kannan gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	How to deal with skewed data?
22:31:37 From  Nikhil Kamma gl  to  Everyone:
	Can you open and show wow.csv
22:31:38 From  Venkateswara Sadu gl  to  Everyone:
	Where can we find the zoom recordings of the class?
22:31:40 From  Isaac Flikier Zelkowicz gl  to  Everyone:
	in which platfrom did you construct the data set you entered as WOW.csv , where did you define the columns and the rows for python to pull them?
22:31:55 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	Which statistical measure would you recommend in this case as average sales since the Mean is not reliable due to the skewed distribution of data ?
22:32:27 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	google sheets, libre office, excel, or notepad haha
22:33:10 From  Kenneth L. Giden gl  to  Everyone:
	Is an .xls or .xlsx file isn't supported?
22:33:11 From  Pratik Das gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	@Brad What is the best way to represent data? I am sure we will not open this editor in front of CEO? using tableau or power point? SO far I have always shown using deck
22:33:16 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	HARIISH: Maybe the issue is not "reliability" of the mean, but the joint interpretation of multiple stats (including meadian, mean, and others) to understand the underlying nature of the distribution
22:33:32 From  Deepak Gaikwad gl  to  Everyone:
	should wow.txt be in same folder as python or same folder as jupyter notebook?
22:33:36 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Kenneth No, you can save it as an .xlsx as well. Pandas has another function called read_xlsx() for that.
22:33:36 From  Mukul Mondal  to  Everyone:
	If any cell is empty does it create any issue?
22:33:38 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	.xls or .xlsx is really complicated compared to .csv and requires additional tools to parse that
22:34:01 From  [GL-PO] Maitri  to  Everyone:
	Hi, The recording this session will be available in your 'Pre Work' course home page under the 'Recording' Header.
22:34:04 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Kenneth - Pandas supports different types of files. You can use read_excel() function to load the excel file.
22:34:18 From  Nageswara Rao Biradhar gl  to  Everyone:
	would not it be a problem when we have comma in the cell value itself in csv ?
22:34:25 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Kenneth: pandas can import multiple formats. https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html
22:34:31 From  Conor Bagnell gl  to  Everyone:
	Where on Great Learning website is wow.csv, I am not finding it at all.
22:34:44 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Deepak Same folder as the Jupyter Notebook
22:34:45 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Nagaswara it is a problem, you can quote the cell to allow commas in the value
22:35:15 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Nagaswara one,two,three,"value , with comma", five
22:35:44 From  James Pinkerton gl  to  Everyone:
	@Nagaswara in my job we often use a | character instead of a comma, and define | as the separating character because it's very uncommon for a field to contain that.
22:36:18 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Mukul No, it is just a missing value for that cell. The missing value can be left as it is, or even filled or that row/column removed if required.
22:36:25 From  Nageswara Rao Biradhar gl  to  Everyone:
	👍
22:37:43 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	5.11 feet = 155.7528 cm
22:38:03 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	@Timo thank you lol
22:38:07 From  weijie yang gl  to  Everyone:
	haha, not very tall.
22:38:09 From  Mark Braxton gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	5 ft 11 in === 5 11/12 in
22:38:13 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	5 feet 11 inches =180 cm
22:39:24 From  Manidip Ghosh gl  to  Everyone:
	can you please send the link to the wow.csv file - I may have missed to see it in the pre work content
22:40:05 From  FABIANA P NOVELLO gl  to  Everyone:
	@Manidip it is on pre engagement session Dataset, I just found it
22:40:21 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	For those wondering, they square it to get rid of the positive or negative sign, to make the value absolute, and it just happens that squaring it works well with "bell" shaped sets of data, using abs() would work well for non bell shaped sets of data
22:40:28 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	mu should be the population mean or the sample mean?
22:40:41 From  Mark Braxton gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	x bar is sample mean
22:40:45 From  Mark Braxton gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Mu is pop mean
22:40:52 From  Manidip Ghosh gl  to  Everyone:
	got it thank you :)
22:41:19 From  ASHUTOSH SINHA gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	in this example, mu appears to be population mean
22:41:58 From  Craig Munnik gl  to  Everyone:
	how should I interpret the actual values of the variance or standard deviation?
22:42:20 From  Animesh Bandyopadhyay gl  to  Everyone:
	for standard deviation, which is the most common use, is it 1/N or 1/N-1. I pre-course there are references to the use of N-1
22:42:28 From  Anita Albert gl  to  Everyone:
	variance is the square of all the diffs from the mean, then take the square root to get the standard deviation. Standard deviation would effectively be the same as simply find the diff from the mean - except that that number would always result in 0 so it is mathematically impossible to calc so we do the square first, then take back to square root. Am I understanding that correctly?
22:42:41 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Craig, I'm still learning, but I think most data sets are bell shaped and standard deviation is a "Step" to simplify the data you work with
22:43:23 From  Sarah Ford gl  to  Everyone:
	@Craig For some intuition on this, recall +/- 1.96 Std Devs from mean is about 95% of values in normal distribution
22:44:24 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Animesh - 1/N-1 is used to calculate sample variance and 1/N is used to calculate population variance.
22:44:41 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@anita Yes
22:45:04 From  Ramanan Kannan gl  to  Everyone:
	What was interpolation = 'midpoint' command in the previous example?
22:45:20 From  Glendon Brown gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	what's the definition of an outlier in this case?
22:45:22 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Craig like, if you were to work with a histogram of data, you don't want to do a report on all of the data, you want to make it as small as possible but as large as necessary, standard deviation is just an amount that is standard in the industry
22:46:29 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	So in our example with a Median of 41.424 and an IQR of 160.496 . the IQR is a better measure for a skewed distribution ..Is my understanding correct ?
22:46:44 From  Animesh Bandyopadhyay gl  to  Everyone:
	are we going to have access to the transcript of this chat, have lot of useful information here
22:47:21 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Animesh We will be releasing a Q&A sheet afterwards for you to refer to the questions and answers from the session
22:47:35 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	ok got it thanks
22:48:04 From  Sandy Kapoor gl  to  Everyone:
	it seems the notebook I downloaded is not as current as your presentation. Is there a newer version I can download
22:48:05 From  Will McGuire gl  to  Everyone:
	when would you not want interpolation to be applied?
22:48:34 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@Glendon Theoretically any point greater than Q3 + 1.5*IQR is consider to be an outlier, or Q1-1.5*IQR
22:49:59 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	@Nikhil why is that considered an outlier? Why not 1.51 or 1.49? What's the logic behind the number?
22:50:58 From  Suruthi Vinoth Kannan gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Do we need to consider negative correlated feature with the target feature, while building predictive model?
22:51:14 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	can you explain the horizontal line?
22:51:55 From  Venkata Suneel Dasika gl  to  Everyone:
	literally did this 2 days ago at work lol
22:51:58 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Chris: if increments in X do not affect y. So maybe no correlation.
22:52:24 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	how would you represent that if it doesn't fall in the 0-1 range and is perfectly horizontal
22:52:39 From  Suruthi Vinoth Kannan gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Is positive correlated and negative correlated  are equally important?
22:53:01 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Suruthi - Yes, negatively correlated are also important in predictive modeling.
22:53:05 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Chirs: I think the coefficient would be 0, but not just random but maybe independent.
22:53:09 From  Santiago Lovato gl  to  Everyone:
	Python knows exactly which columns to use once is analyzing correlations?
22:53:21 From  Mukul Mondal  to  Everyone:
	What about non-linear relation, not like straight line which has only one slope?
22:53:30 From  [GL-TA] Nikhil  to  Everyone:
	@Timo https://www.kaggle.com/general/129242 The following link will help.
22:53:33 From  Mark Braxton gl  to  Everyone:
	can numpy.. calculate probability distributions and bales theorem??
22:53:44 From  Timo Huovinen gl  to  Everyone:
	Thanks @Nikhil
22:54:20 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	it would still be 0 even though it is predictable
22:54:21 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Santiago - It will compute the correlation between all the numerical variables.
22:54:49 From  Svetlana Vo gl  to  Everyone:
	in what situations do we need to use an alias in the formula, in when to just call a function without specifying an alias like "np"?
22:55:19 From  Mohammad Ayub gl  to  Everyone:
	Can you quickly compare what pandas vs numpy vs matplot. thanks
22:55:44 From  Craig Munnik gl  to  Everyone:
	vs scikitlearn??
22:55:57 From  Mark Braxton gl  to  Everyone:
	Can probability distributions and bayes’ theorem calculated in numby…or sci/pi
22:55:58 From  Rahul Chugh gl  to  Everyone:
	when we called data.corr() - why were rest of the columns were ignored and only four are in the table
22:56:26 From  Mohammad Ayub gl  to  Everyone:
	Thanks Brad
22:56:41 From  Oleg V. Levytskyy gl  to  Everyone:
	WHat is a difference using Python vs BI tools like PowerBI, Tablue, QlicView
22:57:05 From  Mukul Mondal  to  Everyone:
	Can we've mixed or complex item in list, set, tuple, dictionary?
	like: can each item in 'list' is a 'set'  OR each value in dictionary is a 'list'
22:57:40 From  Heba Said gl  to  Everyone:
	Is there a switch statement in python? I mean instead of using if elif elif elif elif else
22:57:41 From  FABIANA P NOVELLO gl  to  Everyone:
	how heavy and/or fast (on process thinking) are all this statistic python functions
22:57:53 From  Oleg V. Levytskyy gl  to  Everyone:
	Does Python and it's models cost a lot? vs BI tools?
22:57:54 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	Can we use KNIME with Python
22:57:54 From  Vijay Goswami gl  to  Everyone:
	This was great
