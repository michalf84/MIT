20:19:25 From [GL-TA] Akash to RAVI KUMAR TOLETY gl, Host and Panelists:
	@Vera Q:Can you have too large a sample size that over inflates your confidence of detection… ? Ans: 
	A larger sample size or lower variability will result in a tighter confidence interval with a smaller margin of error. A smaller sample size or a higher variability will result in a wider confidence interval with a larger margin of error.
20:19:26 From Mohamad Khachab gl to Everyone:
	Deciding significance level prior to experiment start to decide sample size.
20:19:53 From Sarah Ford gl to Everyone:
	@Aditya there are formulas for this, depends if you have population parameters and know p-value in advance
20:20:06 From Robert D. Hill gl to Everyone:

20:20:24 From Hongbin Liu gl to Host and Panelists:
	Why large sample size is not included?
20:20:27 From Joby Schaffer gl to Everyone:

20:20:36 From Robert D. Hill gl to Everyone:
	thank you, Joby
20:20:42 From Harold Stamateris gl to Everyone:

20:21:10 From Mohammad Aleem gl to Everyone:
	Hello
20:21:23 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	for example conversion rate for an ad - it is not just launching the ad, there could be seasonality, competitive ads or sales events or several other things affecting the end result
20:21:43 From Srikanth Panchavati gl to Host and Panelists:
	What is a double blind experient?
20:21:43 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	So to the point in the last line you want to make your test as controlled as possible to avoid the effect of other confounding effects
20:21:45 From Martin Niehoff gl to Everyone:
	After doing the randomization, do you check to make sure it worked?
20:21:46 From Nirupana S Natarajan gl to Everyone:
	Difference between control group and treatment group?
20:22:20 From [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal to Everyone:
	@Nirupana - "Treatment group: In this group, people receive a treatment that we are trying to measure the impact of, for example - people who were offered the mammography.	Control group: In this group, people receive no treatment, for example - people who weren't offered the mammography."
20:22:35 From Jesus Chavez gl to Everyone:

20:23:27 From [GL-TA] Avijit Saha to Everyone:
	@ Srikant Q:What is a double blind experient?		A:Double-blind is used in different studies so that neither the patient nor the doctor knows what treatment is given. This is to avoid or minimize bias in the final result of the study.

20:29:54 From Paulo Henrique Horta Nunes gl to Host and Panelists:

20:29:56 From Halyna Hendzelyuk gl to Everyone:
	We should look vs total
20:29:58 From Yusuf Berk Güray gl to Host and Panelists:

20:29:59 From NING LI gl to Host and Panelists:
	1.1/1.5 is the control to 1.1/2.0
20:30:00 From Joseph Tidwell gl to Host and Panelists:
	They could have refused due to previous health issues
20:30:01 From Yuko Iwata gl to Everyone:

	Group Size and Breast No. are very separate from each other.
20:30:04 From Francois Millard gl to Host and Panelists:
	People self select
20:30:04 From Chao Sun gl to Everyone:

20:30:04 From Yuko Iwata gl to Everyone:
	may be affecting
20:30:05 From Eduardo Brandao de Souza Mendes gl to Everyone:
	Because refusing the treatment may have an influence on particular beliefs of the group
20:30:12 From Sebastian Oglaza gl to Everyone:
	People who refused could be already in a bad health
20:30:13 From Mohamad Khachab gl to Everyone:
	Depending on what is the dependent variable.
20:30:13 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	38 vs 21
20:30:19 From Joseph Tidwell gl to Host and Panelists:
	Significant difference in baseline deaths
20:30:22 From Ticiana Beqari gl to Everyone:

20:30:22 From Christopher Carrero gl to Everyone:

20:30:23 From Victor Chavarria gl to Host and Panelists:
	They perhaps refused treatment of any kind
20:30:26 From Suresh Prathipati gl to Everyone:
	Sample size is also small
20:30:26 From Denzel gl to Everyone:
	sample size is significantly smaller
20:30:30 From Robert Gormley gl to Host and Panelists:
	Those patients are being  more frequently examined than control
20:30:31 From Michael Caldwell gl to Everyone:
	2x...group likely already had it
20:30:32 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	Its high for refused but this is a subset for treatment where N is 10.8K
20:30:35 From Cristiano Buizza gl to Everyone:
	People who refused has a higher risk for death for every type of death
20:30:41 From Surya Gutta gl to Host and Panelists:
	They may not care about their health that well
20:30:42 From Cristiano Buizza gl to Everyone:
	so they are weaker
20:30:42 From Alex Theobald gl to Host and Panelists:
	Reasons for refusal are vast compared to reasons for being in the control group
20:31:04 From David Ball gl to Everyone:
	“Refused” is ambiguous , does it include women who refused ALL screenings and some that had some of the screenings but not all of them?
20:31:31 From Prerna Mathur gl to Host and Panelists:
	Income
20:31:36 From Robert Gormley gl to Host and Panelists:
	refused group may have more comorbidities
20:31:54 From Kuldeep Rawat gl to Everyone:
	Correct, refused at what stage???
20:31:59 From Shan Siddiqui gl to Everyone:
	They had other comorbidities which made it difficult for them to participate
20:32:11 From Dayna Levy gl to Everyone:
	but doesn't the control also have a choice about whether to get treatment? just not proactively offered. so dont we need to break out the control group to those who got screened and those who didn't
20:32:20 From Surya Gutta gl to Host and Panelists:
	In that case screened group and control group is not equally representative
20:32:34 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	its still biased
20:32:40 From Paula Iglesias Otarola gl to Everyone:
	biased too
20:32:43 From Kuldeep Rawat gl to Everyone:
	Controlled group does not get the treatment
20:32:50 From Cristiano Buizza gl to Everyone:
	We are assuming that all the controls did not do mammography. But maybe it is not the case
20:32:51 From Kiranmayi Vedantham gl to Host and Panelists:
	Biases cox they’re not randomly assigned
20:32:52 From Lucy Edosomwan gl to Everyone:
	the sample size is way smaller between screened and control
20:32:59 From Alex Theobald gl to Host and Panelists:
	Self-selection biased
20:33:01 From Robert Gormley gl to Host and Panelists:
	population should include refuse people
20:33:16 From LISMI AUGUSTINE gl to Everyone:
	1.3 vs 2.3
20:33:17 From Dayna Levy gl to Everyone:
	control just has their standard insurance - doesn't mean they cant get a mammogram, right?
20:33:31 From Harold Stamateris gl to Everyone:
	control group, if offered the choice, would have members who would want to be screened and who would refuse.
20:33:41 From Kuldeep Rawat gl to Everyone:
	They can, but not as part of this study
20:33:57 From Mohamad Khachab gl to Everyone:
	Can we measure screening contribution by comparing 1.1 vs. 2.0.
20:34:36 From Shilpa Tyagi gl to Everyone:
	why is 1.3 vs 2.0 the right comparison? isn't 1.3 coming from a biased group?
20:34:52 From Rashidi D Barnett gl to Host and Panelists:
	i have the same question Shilpa
20:34:55 From HARIISH UPPILI gl to Everyone:
	So the comparison is being made based on Patients who were offered treatment vs those not ?
20:35:07 From Yusuf Berk Güray gl to Host and Panelists:
	How can we modify this research to exactly evaluate doing a mammogram success rather than offering?
20:35:09 From HARIISH UPPILI gl to Everyone:
	Is this correct ?
20:35:09 From Sarah Barthelet gl to Everyone:
	Shilpa, it is because the test is whether “offering” the treatment is useful
20:35:14 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	Do you always need equal sample sizes in control and treatment?
20:35:24 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	or what is the threshold of how different they can be
20:35:41 From Harold Stamateris gl to Everyone:
	I don't think so because you ultimately are looking at rates
20:36:11 From Alex Theobald gl to Host and Panelists:
	Dijot, for a robust study, yes
20:36:35 From Alex Theobald gl to Host and Panelists:
	Different sample sizes can produce sample biases to the study
20:36:54 From Mohamad Khachab gl to Everyone:
	Is comparing 1.3 vs. 2.0 is comparing treatment vs. control regardless if they were screened or refused screening.
20:37:07 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	But the rates will be disproportionate if your sample sizes are not closely equal
20:37:24 From Sarah Barthelet gl to Everyone:
	Mohamad, yes
20:37:43 From Tze Yang Ng gl to Everyone:
	seem like this sampling did not take into account ethicity
20:37:49 From Paula Iglesias Otarola gl to Everyone:
	don't we need to "correct" considering that control group have 28 versus 27 in total dead rate?
20:38:00 From Sarah Barthelet gl to Everyone:
	Mohamad, “You can bring a horse to water but cannot make him drink 🙂 "
20:38:15 From Paula Iglesias Otarola gl to Everyone:
	thaks
20:39:31 From Ram Srinivasan gl to Host and Panelists:
	To clarify are we testing for “offering mammographies” or “mammographies” themselves?
20:40:25 From [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal to Everyone:
	@Ram - Offering Mammography
20:40:44 From Ram Srinivasan gl to Host and Panelists:
	thanks!
20:41:13 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	Why Bernoulli and not binomial?
20:41:19 From HARIISH UPPILI gl to Everyone:
	hmm so the null Hypothesis is offering a treatment reduces the risk of death from breast cancer . alternate hyposthesis is treatment does not reduce the risk of death from breast cancer
20:41:36 From Mike Hankinson gl to Everyone:
	whaat is pi?
20:41:41 From Riaz U Ahmed gl to Everyone:
	@Harish - actually the opposite
20:41:42 From Daniel Dorfman gl to Everyone:
	I believe Bernoulli because it's a 1 or 0 result
20:41:59 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	but we’re doing this experiment across 31000 people?
20:42:20 From Suresh Prathipati gl to Everyone:
	Isn’t Bernoulli trial size =1
20:42:25 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	ok maybe explained differently in the videos
20:42:25 From Suresh Prathipati gl to Everyone:
	We should use binomial?
20:42:30 From Sara Rahme gl to Host and Panelists:
	But only once.
20:42:39 From Karen Stuhlmiller gl to Everyone:
	why isn't this binomial?
20:42:42 From Nitin Goalla gl to Everyone:
	When should we use Binomial?
20:42:43 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	In the mentor session it was also mentioned N = 1
20:42:49 From Rodrigo Senra gl to Everyone:
	Exactly. We have 39 deaths (trials). I would say it will be binomial
20:42:50 From Daniel Dorfman gl to Everyone:
	Bernoulli P of all results = 1, not sample size
20:43:09 From Nageswara Rao Biradhar gl to Everyone:
	please clarify why not Binomial
20:43:16 From Ashwin Patha gl to Everyone:
	because the sample size is more
20:43:28 From Alex Theobald gl to Host and Panelists:
	Trial is equal to 1 in this case “offering mammography” vs “not offering”
20:43:32 From Sara Rahme gl to Everyone:
	Experiment/survey per sample is only done once with 2 possible outcomes
20:43:42 From Oluboni Agbaniyaka gl to Everyone:
	are pi and mean interchangeable here?
20:43:57 From Pooja Chopra gl to Everyone:
	why an alternative needs to be defined with null hypothesis
20:44:01 From Michael Caldwell gl to Everyone:
	if we know the treatment group is .0013, don't we already have our answer?
20:44:08 From Karen Stuhlmiller gl to Everyone:
	pi is proportion
20:44:08 From HARIISH UPPILI gl to Everyone:
	How did we determine the threshold pie =0.002 ?
20:44:08 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	oh ok that clarifies thank you :)
20:44:44 From Suresh Prathipati gl to Everyone:
	Why alternate be less than
20:44:46 From HARIISH UPPILI gl to Everyone:
	ok thank you
20:44:48 From Suresh Prathipati gl to Everyone:
	Can it be not equal?
20:45:08 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	^ equality is usually in your null
20:45:24 From Christopher Carrero gl to Everyone:
	concurrently determined control group death rate is the do-nothing H0 to which the treatment Ha is compared
20:45:24 From Raji Kandan gl to Everyone:
	isn't the deaths per 1000?don't we have to multiply by 1000
20:45:26 From Hillary (Uyen) Dang gl to Everyone:
	why is the null not >= 0.002?
20:45:48 From Tze Yang Ng gl to Everyone:
	null is status quo
20:45:53 From Sara Rahme gl to Everyone:
	Isn’t it confusing to use Pi instead of any other variable? Since Pi is its own number?
20:46:00 From William Ricci gl to Everyone:
	Equal is always in the null, <=, =, =>  Alternative never has equal, < > not=
20:46:00 From Nitin Goalla gl to Everyone:
	@Suresh, not equal will not prove our assumption that Mammography reduces the risk of death.
20:46:20 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	T stat is always with samples correct?
20:46:26 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	z is with POP
20:47:03 From Christopher Carrero gl to Everyone:
	pi in statistics context is defined as population proportion, not the 3.14... constant used in geometry
20:47:07 From Pooja Chopra gl to Everyone:
	Why alternative is needed to be defined with null hypothesis-->it is when mammography is not offered, right?
20:47:30 From Nitin Goalla gl to Everyone:
	To my understanding, T is used when we don't know standard deviation..
20:48:12 From Maristela Monteiro gl to Everyone:
	The Alternative H is one tailed, shouldn't it be 2 tailed?
20:48:31 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	^ no because your alternative is look at death rate is lower
20:48:35 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	Not Lower and higher
20:48:39 From Deepak Gaikwad gl to Everyone:
	wonder what was the alpha for covid vaccine testing, probably 0.1
20:48:40 From Nageswara Rao Biradhar gl to Everyone:
	are there any methods to determine alpha? who determines it in an org?
20:48:46 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	2 tailed is when you have an alt of “not equal to"
20:48:48 From Kuldeep Rawat gl to Everyone:
	single tailed as we claim that deaths are reduced
20:49:19 From Maristela Monteiro gl to Everyone:
	But we really don't know that, in principle
20:49:33 From Kurt Borg gl to Everyone:
	Can you discuss  p-value
20:49:34 From Eduardo Brandao de Souza Mendes gl to Everyone:
	- To be sure about understanding, the 0.05 value is the integration from 0 to the red line, right?
20:49:44 From Divesh Solanki gl to Everyone:
	how can I disable chat notification ?
20:50:36 From Suresh Prathipati gl to Everyone:
	We really didn’t use treatment group data at all in our hypothesis testing but we able to conclude we cn reject null?
20:50:37 From [GL-TA] Akash to Everyone:
	@Nageswara To get α subtract your confidence level from 1. For example, if you want to be 95 percent confident that your analysis is correct, the alpha level would be 1 – . 95 = 5 percent, assuming you had a one tailed test. For two-tailed tests, divide the alpha level by 2
20:51:47 From Kurt Borg gl to Everyone:
	Is this the formula for One-Tail Less than type	Ha : 𝜇 < 𝜇0
20:52:41 From Vera Pfeiffer gl to Everyone:
	If your sample size is giant and you can detect a tiny difference - are some differences too small to matter?
20:52:47 From Timothy Watson Innes gl to Everyone:
	we reject null, do there is evidence that the treatment is effective?
20:53:39 From Eduardo Brandao de Souza Mendes gl to Everyone:
	- When physicists talk about having a 5-sigma confidence in a discovery, does that mean that the alpha is such that the acceptance will be 5-sigma away from the mean?
20:53:53 From Ashwin Patha gl to Everyone:
	So we dont need alternate hypothesis because p value is 0.002 which is less than 0.05?
20:54:11 From Suresh Prathipati gl to Everyone:
	Where do we use treatment group informaiton?
20:54:15 From Thanh Dang gl to Everyone:
	Does T (count of deaths) follow a normal distribution as a result of the CLT?
20:54:16 From Dr Vincent Grek gl to Everyone:
	Could you please comment on secondary enpoints? and composite enpoints?
20:54:22 From Lucy Edosomwan gl to Everyone:
	so in this case we reject alpha?
20:54:23 From Dr Vincent Grek gl to Everyone:
	Dr Grek
20:54:27 From Chris Lieberman gl to Host and Panelists:
	Is the alternative hypothesis then accepted?
20:55:17 From Xiaofei Gong gl to Everyone:
	Is this using the cdf of binomial distribution to calculate 0.0012?
20:55:48 From LISMI AUGUSTINE gl to Everyone:
	how to find p-value?
20:56:01 From Cristiano Buizza gl to Everyone:
	don't we have to estimate also the confidence interval before accepting or refusing the Hp null?
20:56:05 From Xiaofei Gong gl to Everyone:
	thanks!

21:28:23 From Eduardo Brandao de Souza Mendes gl to Everyone:
	- Are the principal components a subset of covariats or is it rather a linear combination of the covariats?
21:28:29 From Omar Fahmy gl to Everyone:

21:28:41 From Shan Siddiqui gl to Everyone:
	What are the principle components in this case? Subset of the DNA?
21:28:43 From Chiedu Michael Okwechime gl to Everyone:

	If you run multiple PCA - do you sometimes get different results?

21:30:30 From Sara Rahme gl to Everyone:
	Differences in DNA. Like Russian DNA would be most different from Spain…exactly what we see from a distance POV
21:30:39 From Al Ganeshkumar gl to Everyone:
	How do you map a PC to map to the data point , like dna
21:30:43 From [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal to Everyone:
	@Vera - Q: If you run multiple PCA - do you sometimes get different results?	A: No. PCA will give the same result each time we run the algorithm
21:30:59 From NING LI gl to Host and Panelists:
	Will you know exactly what that PC1 and PC2 are? What they stand for in the dataset?
21:31:25 From Alvin Kuo gl to Everyone:
	It sounds like the PC1 is very important - if this is very significant, strongly good direction to start to make PCA successful…?
21:32:11 From Zach Barnett gl to Host and Panelists:
	are these vectors computed in photon?
21:33:13 From [GL-TA] Avijit Saha to Everyone:
	@NING PC1 is the linear combination with the largest possible explained variation, and PC2 is the best of what's left.
21:33:14 From [GL-TA] Akash to Prerna Mathur gl, Host and Panelists:
	@Chiedu  PC1 axis is the first principal direction along which the samples show the largest variation. The PC2 axis is the second most important direction and it is orthogonal to the PC1 axis. The first two PC's explain 50% of variation in original data
21:33:23 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	Is it variation within one co variate or all
21:33:43 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	what is some co variates have little to no variation and others have a lot
21:33:54 From Wilberto W Montoya gl to Everyone:
	interesting is like Word2Vec in Machine Learning
21:33:55 From Maristela Monteiro gl to Everyone:
	Can it be used to test if a questionnaire is assessing several dimensions of a behavior or not?
21:34:14 From MAHZABEEN RAHMAN gl to Everyone:

21:35:59 From [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal to Everyone:
	@Mahzabeen - Q: Since the PCs are orthogonal, so more than three PCs conflict with orthogonality?	A: No. We can have any N directions as orthogonal, however, we cannot visualize more than 3 dimensions
21:36:06 From Joseph Tidwell gl to Everyone:
	Yes
21:36:10 From Michael Caldwell gl to Everyone:
	no
21:36:10 From Sara Rahme gl to Everyone:

21:36:23 From Santiago Lovato gl to Everyone:
	no
21:36:30 From Mario Diaz-Laguardia gl to Host and Panelists:
	no
21:36:30 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	No same proportion of variance?
21:36:35 From Joseph W. Kinsella gl to Everyone:
	% variation does not change
21:36:46 From [GL] Vishnu Subramanian to Everyone:
	@Chris Q: Is a PCA analysis limited to a maximum of 3 variables REGARDLESS of the number of absolute variables Ans: No, you can have as many Principal Components as desired as long as it's smaller than or equal to the original number of features. It's just that 3 is the limit for visualizing the prinicipal components, and we cannot visualize orthogonal dimensions more than three in number.
21:36:49 From Sara Rahme gl to Everyone:
	Adjust the scale of the plot
21:36:56 From Abdelaziz Aitouchen gl to Host and Panelists:
	normalization need to be applied?
21:37:06 From John Yarborough gl to Everyone:
	And if you changed age to measure in days or hours, it would change it again.
21:37:07 From Sunil Acharya gl to Everyone:
	can you normalize data in all directions?
21:37:07 From Xiaofei Gong gl to Everyone:
	standardize the data 
21:37:10 From HARIISH UPPILI gl to Everyone:
	So shd we not use one basis of measurement ?
21:37:50 From Sunil Acharya gl to Everyone:
	why variance and not square root of variance?
21:38:04 From Eduardo Brandao de Souza Mendes gl to Everyone:
	- What would be the normalization method? subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation? dividing by the maximum, …?
21:38:21 From Cristiano Buizza gl to Everyone:
	And when data have outliers?
21:39:17 From Diallo Bocar Elimane gl to Everyone:
	Use correlation how?
21:39:31 From FABIANA P NOVELLO gl to Everyone:
	would this PCA be able to identify false positives? like variation common in DNA from US or BR citzens (my DNA is 70% from Europe and I am Brazilian)
21:39:33 From Cristiano Buizza gl to Everyone:
	Is not possible to apply a logarithmic transformation of Xs before applying PCA to avoid outliers issues?
21:39:45 From [GL-TA] Avijit Saha to Everyone:
	@Ginger Q: How do you account for variables that have large interactive affects in pca.	A:  If N variables are highly correlated than they will all load out on the same Principal Component (Eigenvector), not different ones. This is how you identify them as being highly correlated.
21:42:40 From Mohammad Aleem gl to Everyone:
	Are these chats saved in text format somewhere that I could pull later on?
21:44:16 From [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal to Everyone:
	@Mohammad - Yes, the chat will be shared on Olympus after the session.
21:44:29 From Glendon Brown gl to Everyone:
	Gaussian dist is normal dist?
21:44:51 From Suresh Prathipati gl to Everyone:
	What are those two dimensions?
21:45:04 From Estelle Pearl Yuzicappi gl to Host and Panelists:
	Thank you Mohammad
21:45:15 From Wilberto W Montoya gl to Everyone:
	that is what you want to find
21:45:15 From Eduardo Brandao de Souza Mendes gl to Everyone:
	- What 'as similar as possible' means in mathematical terms?
21:45:25 From Kalpana Singh gl to Everyone:
	what will be mean and std for gausiians
21:46:23 From Jesus Chavez gl to Everyone:
	the Gaussian distribution for every point is coming from a group of so-rounded points?
21:46:41 From Eduardo Brandao de Souza Mendes gl to Everyone:
	- Is such method deterministic or it can give different results depending on some seed?
21:46:45 From Sunil Acharya gl to Everyone:
	is it still using eigenvectors and removing zeros from the diagnolized matrix in this (SNE) approach?
21:46:55 From Kuldeep Rawat gl to Everyone:
	Are SNE and Gaussian Mixture Model the same?
21:47:20 From Nikhil Kamma gl to Host and Panelists:
	What does it mean to put t-dist over each data?
21:49:10 From MAHZABEEN RAHMAN gl to Everyone:
	Why using only Normal or T distribution? Because the original data may follow other distribution.
21:50:16 From Sara Rahme gl to Everyone:
	Can it be thought of as ‘’tangents’’ along the axis?
21:50:26 From Steven Rubio gl to Host and Panelists:
	This is awesome.
21:51:23 From Fernando Garcia Corona gl to Everyone:
	and which ones do you discard?
21:51:27 From Sunil Acharya gl to Everyone:
	-how do you relate observations from lower embeddings back to real variables that have practical meaning?
21:51:30 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	are there underlying requirements in the dataset where one type of dimensionality reduction approach is preferred over the other?
21:51:47 From Eduardo Brandao de Souza Mendes gl to Everyone:
	- Is such thing deterministic or it can give different results depending on some ranndomm seed?
21:52:14 From Wilberto W Montoya gl to Everyone:
	big difference
21:52:15 From Alvin Kuo gl to Everyone:
	@mahzabeen because of sampling process…
21:52:39 From HARIISH UPPILI gl to Everyone:
	This is great for customer grouping
21:52:53 From Nikhil Kamma gl to Host and Panelists:
	Can you explain (maybe I missed) how these clusters come about
21:54:13 From Mohammad Ayub gl to Everyone:
	Seems to me tSNE is good for cell imaging?
21:54:47 From Cristiano Buizza gl to Everyone:
	just to be sure, we have a database with 1800 rows and 64 columns?
21:55:06 From Cristiano Buizza gl to Everyone:
	thanks
21:55:13 From Glendon Brown gl to Everyone:
	The time label above the figures is calculation time?
21:55:36 From [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal to Everyone:
	@ Eduardo - - Is such thing deterministic or it can give different results depending on some random seed?	A: It is deterministic. We can set random_state to fix the results
21:55:39 From Chao Sun gl to Everyone:
	Do you do normalization for the raw data before PCA or tsne?
21:55:40 From Taishu Tozawa gl to Host and Panelists:
	Seems like tSNE takes a lot longer to compute. Any circumstances where PCA is more useful?

	Are there test to define the best option in t-sne?
22:00:49 From Al Ganeshkumar gl to Everyone:
	Is there going to be an exercise for us to do PCA and t-SNW
22:01:03 From Sophia Schröer gl to Everyone:
	Side note on this dataset: There's a cool 'competition' in Kaggle, the Digit Recognizer, where you can practice basics of computer vision on these digits.
22:01:04 From Eduardo Brandao de Souza Mendes gl to Everyone:
	- We cannot visualize 10 but we can still have 10 components right?
22:01:05 From Dominic H. Goodall gl to Everyone:
	What would you use for the simulations of this over time?
22:01:14 From Dominic H. Goodall gl to Everyone:
	Tools, software
22:02:03 From Sara Rahme gl to Everyone:

22:04:06 From Rodrigo Senra gl to Everyone:
	Sorry. Have to go. Good luck
22:04:54 From Nageswara Rao Biradhar gl to Everyone:
	Hi Brad, please explain correction(FWR and FDR) in simple words and an example
22:05:54 From Joby Schaffer gl to Everyone:
	With PCA and other clustering, how are we to interpret the clusters that emerge (not in the sense of capturing the direction of variance, but in the sense of what underlying phenomenon exists in the real world that is captured by the component)?
22:05:59 From Wilberto W Montoya gl to Everyone:
	Why Holm-Beonferoni and Benjamini-Hochberg assign Pm<=alpha  when i = m while when i = 1 is a fraction of alpha? is like make things easy for higher P values
22:06:32 From Al Ganeshkumar gl to Everyone:
	Id there  a jupitor notebook example and data to play with PCA etc and see how its actually computed and visualize..
22:07:02 From Lucy Edosomwan gl to Everyone:
	Thank you
22:07:18 From Nikhil Kamma gl to Host and Panelists:
	How do the clusters actually emerge in t-sne
22:07:23 From HARIISH UPPILI gl to Everyone:
	Can we use FWER followed by FDR ?
22:07:33 From Alvin Kuo gl to Everyone:
	The usage today in the industry how poplar are FWER and FDR? Is it majority now?
22:07:34 From [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal to Everyone:
	@Al - Yes, LVC Practical Application Notebook will be released after the lecture
22:08:47 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	that is a great explanation of PCA
22:08:49 From Al Ganeshkumar gl to Everyone:
	👍
22:09:00 From Shan Siddiqui gl to Everyone:
	Great explanation for PCA
22:09:02 From Lucy Edosomwan gl to Everyone:
	Wow
22:09:07 From Diljot Chhina gl to Everyone:
	I get it now haha
22:09:11 From William Corwin gl to Everyone:
	Thank you!
22:09:27 From Ginger Wisseman gl to Everyone:
	Do the components need to be expressed as continuous/numerical values or can we use categorical or discrete variables?
22:10:00 From Thanh Dang gl to Everyone:
	why is there a randomness in the outcome of the t-SNE?
22:10:17 From Wilberto W Montoya gl to Everyone:
	most likely T-SNE will combine features to determine the plane then, thank you
22:10:26 From Leng Khye Sut gl to Everyone:
	👍
22:11:02 From Chris Lieberman gl to Everyone:
	Are PCA and tSNE used strictly for data exploration or is actually used in a production ML/DL model?
22:13:29 From Al Ganeshkumar gl to Everyone:
	Is degrees the freedom is same as talking about sample size
22:13:53 From Chris Lieberman gl to Host and Panelists:
	Just to clarify, are PCA and tSNE techniques used for data exploration, or are these leveraged for production level ML/DL models?
22:14:23 From Wilberto W Montoya gl to Everyone:
	Encode like in Word2Vec
22:14:52 From [GL] Vishnu Subramanian to Everyone:
	@Chris They are used in production level models too, they're essentially a means to understand which features or transformed features would have the most predictive power in a future model
22:15:52 From Wilberto W Montoya gl to Everyone:
	Mores is better 😉
22:16:15 From Shan Siddiqui gl to Everyone:
	Is 30 a typical number to choose?
22:17:31 From Chris Lieberman gl to Host and Panelists:
	How can PCA include more than 3 covariants as each needs to be at right angles?  Even in multi-dimensions this doesn’t make sense.
22:17:39 From Lucy Edosomwan gl to Everyone:
	Any book recommendation on PowerAnalysis
22:17:56 From Estelle Pearl Yuzicappi gl to Everyone:
	Good question!
22:18:31 From An Van gl to Everyone:
	How to know when we should use PCA vs T-SNE?
22:19:03 From Lucy Edosomwan gl to Everyone:
	What is the value of additional dimensions in a business sense
22:19:08 From Nikhil Kamma gl to Host and Panelists:
	What is the significance of orthogonality
22:19:20 From Glendon Brown gl to Everyone:
	The 4th dimension is time (for visualization)
22:19:24 From Chris Lieberman gl to Host and Panelists:
	Thanks!
22:19:53 From Sunil Acharya gl to Everyone:
	orthogonal = independent
22:21:57 From Ruth Ndila Ndeto gl to Everyone:
	Can we use dimensionality reduction and feature selection interchangeably?
22:22:06 From Joby Schaffer gl to Everyone:
	Will you put these dimensionality reduction methods in the context of feature selection for ML? In other words, when we talk about feature specification before we actually specify and calculate ML models, what other methods beyond PCA and T-SNE will we commonly use?
