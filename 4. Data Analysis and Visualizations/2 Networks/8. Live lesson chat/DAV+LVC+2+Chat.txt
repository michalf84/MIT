21:28:08 From  [GL-TA] Avijit  to  Everyone:
	@Arnold Q:How is betweenness different from degree?	A: Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a node lies on paths between other nodes i.e how many times this node is used for the flow of information.
21:29:22 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	@arnold: also think about local (degree) and global (betweeness) properties
21:30:22 From  Srikanth Panchavati gl  to  Everyone:

	Can this become recursive in closed network?
21:36:30 From  Kenneth L. Giden gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	I would be interested to know how this would correlate to actual “content” that people post.  Sounds like that would be another variable, but how?  # of likes?  # of comments?
21:38:15 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Do Eigenvectors have a “start point”?
21:38:20 From  Dominic H. Goodall gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	There is a blue dialogue box in the upper-right about PDFs that will possible cover content.
21:38:39 From  Erika Spangler gl  to  Everyone:

21:44:48 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	In marketing these are called “influencers"
21:44:53 From  [GL-TA] Avijit  to  Everyone:
	@Chris - Q:Do Eigenvectors have a “start point”?	A:Eigenvector centrality gives each node a score that is proportional to the sum of the scores of all its neighbors. Initially, we start with equal centrality for all nodes.
21:45:04 From  Rajagopalan Kasthurirangan gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	influencers
21:45:11 From  Kenneth L. Giden gl  to  Everyone:
	Does content matter?  Is that another link?  I mean in terms of number of “likes” per post…or “comments”…. How does that affect degree?
21:45:29 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Ah!  Thx!
21:45:48 From  Erika Spangler gl  to  Everyone:
	I’m still confused what part is adjacency in this example? I assume the eigenvalue is calculated from the nextwork. I get the stabilization idea.
21:45:49 From  Kenneth L. Giden gl  to  Everyone:
	I get the “number of friends”, but does it matter the popularity of their posts?
21:46:03 From  Mohamad Khachab gl  to  Everyone:
	How is that used of Electronic armies per se in disiminating erroneous information in political campaigns.
21:46:18 From  William Corwin gl  to  Everyone:
	Can a network depend on other networks, or be connected?
21:46:24 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	@kenneth: popularity in that discussion is more about the topology of the graph
21:46:27 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	What if the quality of websites is different - is it always based on the number of websites its connected to - going back to page rank example

	Was 11 rounds the least number of rounds to map the whole network?
21:54:37 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:

21:55:27 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	how do we interpret 86 and 83 in phase 11
21:55:31 From  Prerna Mathur gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Would 14 and 22 not be betweness
21:55:41 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	They escaped? :)
21:55:53 From  Dominic H. Goodall gl  to  Everyone:
	Betweenness is not relevant for 22 and 14 in Phase 8?
21:56:04 From  Glendon Brown gl  to  Everyone:
	person 86 and 83 are not connected but shown on the graph?
21:56:29 From  Michael Allerheiligen gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Do the different phases represent changes in the network or an increase of information about the network?

	To Vera: I think if you are studying the health of an ecosystem and are tagging animals, each animal could be a node with a classification of their assumed tier on the local food chain. ofc tagging some animals would be impractical/impossible, but this would be a guess on a possible application to ecosystem biology

22:03:16 From  Sergio Bracho Argotte gl  to  Everyone:
	Hi Brad
22:03:17 From  Joby Schaffer gl  to  Everyone:
	Very interesting, but I struggle to see the application of network analysis in business practice to inform decision-making outside of a business model that's premised on a social network - i.e., automating network data collection and ongoing analysis of network change over time to inform business decision-making. Could you share examples of how companies are using network analysis?
22:04:11 From  Eleanor Schlechter gl  to  Everyone:
	We use network analysis to track access management within a form as well as analyzing investment decisions across customers
22:04:22 From  William Corwin gl  to  Everyone:
	This guy is my favorite tbh
22:04:31 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	@joby: you could analyse your team topologies, the communication paths within the organization, or contacts from Linkedin to leverage new biz leads
22:04:40 From  [GL-PO] Maitri  to  Glendon Brown gl and all panelists:
	@Glendon Hello, You have one project , however there will be one quiz that will follow with every live lecture. So that is 3 weekly quizzes for 3 topics and one project in a week.
22:04:41 From  Eleanor Schlechter gl  to  Everyone:
	I work in the financial services industry. used to be in our enterprise cyber security department, but have since switched to asset management
22:04:42 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	ah, that is what the phases are
22:05:19 From  Mike Hankinson gl  to  Everyone:
	Where is the Game of Thrones data set Caroline referenced?
22:05:46 From  Nageswara Rao Biradhar gl  to  Everyone:
	Do we need to remember or go through the matrix formulae or remembering the concept and what the output of the function in Python represents is enough to apply it to the real world problems?
22:05:53 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Mike - It will be released after the lecture
22:05:56 From  Alex Theobald gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Thanks for asking Vishnu 🙂
22:06:05 From  Mike Hankinson gl  to  Everyone:
	Thanks!
22:06:06 From  Alex Theobald gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	I’m a therapist so it makes sense that I asked this question then haha
22:09:09 From  Sridhar R. Papagari Sangareddy gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	How does one go about determining which attributes are important to suggest new connections?
22:09:32 From  Will McGuire gl  to  Everyone:
	echo chamber
22:09:33 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Theres studies around building a successful data science team around the logic being explained about diff networks
22:09:45 From  Jesus Chavez gl  to  Everyone:
	wow! this is awesome
22:10:41 From  Will McGuire gl  to  Everyone:
	phase 11 nodes 82 and 83
22:10:52 From  Saradha Ravi gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	any information on commonly used methods of pruning graphs for large or sparse graphs?
22:11:15 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	So component size can include something with no edges?
22:11:37 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	what do I look into for that?
22:11:38 From  Blessy Joy Chamaparampil gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Can you explain PCA Algorithm?
22:12:00 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	@Mike Hankinson Eleanor asked the same q, and got replied in QA that they will release after lecture 🙂
22:12:04 From  Vera Pfeiffer gl  to  Everyone:
	There was a moment when Dr. Uhler was talking about how the eigenvector centrality measure converges… why is that important?
22:13:07 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	eigenvectors are easy to compute that many iterations
22:13:21 From  Vera Pfeiffer gl  to  Everyone:
	And does that relate to each value calculation or the overall total for each point?
22:13:23 From  Saradha Ravi gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	wonderful..thank you!
22:14:19 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	So what Bradford is saying similar to finding an "embedded" dimension? or is the matrix "A" always have a full rank (no zero eigenvalues)?
22:14:57 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Do eigenvectors have a starting point?
22:16:31 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	thats an awesome explanation
22:16:38 From  Vera Pfeiffer gl  to  Everyone:
	So there’s only one solution for each point for each network
22:16:40 From  Anastasia Hervas gl  to  Everyone:
	Great explanation, thank you!
22:16:45 From  Vera Pfeiffer gl  to  Everyone:

22:18:55 From  Christopher Carrero gl  to  Everyone:
	"bounce rate"
22:18:58 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:

	Hi Vishnu, It is helpful if you can upload the Q&A portion as well when you upload the comments to Olympus.
22:24:18 From  Sarah Barthelet gl  to  Everyone:
	Google has to use a proprietary mix of approaches… many of them just mentioned. If they were to publish all the details people could design websites to fare artificially well on the metrics being used. I suggest you read about Goldheart’s Law  or there is a nice podcast on this in an episode of Data Skeptic
