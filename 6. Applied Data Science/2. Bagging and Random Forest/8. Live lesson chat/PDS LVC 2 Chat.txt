20:09:11 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	How is depth typically measured?  By ALL nodes or nodes - root?
20:11:07 From  Mark Braxton gl  to  Everyone:
	Can someone explain impurities in regard to parent and child nodes in more detail?
20:11:07 From  [GL-TA] Ajith  to  Everyone:
	@Chris - Q: How is depth typically measured?  By ALL nodes or nodes - root?		A: Depth –The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node. We just count how many edges between the targeting node and the root.
20:11:16 From  Jesus Chavez gl  to  Everyone:
	GM, professor mentioned the thick of the line represents the amount of the values, but I don't see any difference
20:13:40 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	From what I understand Your parent node is the previous node to the child node - as you add more nodes the homogeneity increases which means the impurity decreases
20:13:47 From  Pornthip Suyasith gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	What is max depth?
20:13:48 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	@JEsus, I think he meant the thickness of the color how dark or light it is
20:14:18 From  Paula Iglesias Otárola gl  to  Everyone:
	yes, box color
20:14:20 From  RAVI KUMAR TOLETY gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	True that @Fernando
20:14:33 From  [GL-TA] Jai  to  Everyone:
	@Diljot , Yes.
20:15:16 From  Jesus Chavez gl  to  Everyone:
	oh! box color
20:15:21 From  Jesus Chavez gl  to  Everyone:
	gotcha
20:15:23 From  Jesus Chavez gl  to  Everyone:
	thanks
20:16:03 From  [GL-TA] Jai  to  Everyone:
	Pornthip- Q:What is max depth?
	A:The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. It is a hyper parameter in Decision Trees.
20:16:35 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	so variance = overfit?
20:16:51 From  Erika Spangler gl  to  Everyone:
	Extremely low variance = overfit
20:17:02 From  Shilpa Tyagi gl  to  Everyone:
	low bias+high variance= overfit
20:17:29 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	ok we need the low bias too thanks
20:17:31 From  Shilpa Tyagi gl  to  Everyone:
	low bias on train and high variance on test
20:17:41 From  Shilpa Tyagi gl  to  Everyone:
	causes overfitting
20:18:13 From  NING LI gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	For each new level of the DT, the information gain is calculated on top of the previous level or it is always referring to the gain from the root, please?
20:18:51 From  [GL-TA] Jai  to  Everyone:
	@Shilpa - Q:low bias+high variance= overfit
	A: Yes, if the model has low bias and high variance, we can say it is overfitted
20:18:56 From  [GL-TA] Avijit  to  Everyone:
	@Wiberto    -Q:so variance = overfit?	A:The variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. 	When a model overfits the training data, it is said to have high variance.
20:19:25 From  Nageswara Rao Biradhar gl  to  Everyone:
	So can I state that Pruning is similar to feature selection in regression?
20:19:41 From  [GL-TA] Ajith  to  Everyone:
	@Erika - Q: Extremely low variance = overfit		A: Overfit refers to low bias and high variance
20:20:14 From  Erika Spangler gl  to  Everyone:
	Of the test data.
20:20:15 From  Erika Spangler gl  to  Everyone:
	?
20:21:28 From  Natalia Pacheco Fallas gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	What is easier to fix or what is worst to have? Variance or bias?
20:21:35 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	What is meant by “how much we lose” in pruning
20:21:50 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	For each new level of the DT, the information gain is calculated on top of the previous level or it is always referring to the gain from the root, please?
20:22:01 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	can we prune top down vs bottom up? Or maybe we can start anywhere?
20:22:07 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	^ locally
20:22:25 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	@NING I think it’s previos
20:23:37 From  Diallo Bocar Elimane gl  to  Everyone:
	What is the reasonable entropy?
20:23:40 From  [GL-TA] Maruthi Reddy  to  Everyone:
	@Nageshwara- Q: So can I state that Pruning is similar to feature selection in regression?	A: Pruning is similar to Lasso Method in regression.
20:24:44 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	what does this mean “aggregate leaves all the way to the node”
20:25:26 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Is the intent of pruning to reduce nodes so that it reduces both misclassification error and overfit?
20:25:48 From  Svetlana Vo gl  to  Everyone:
	to avoid doing pruning, can you state a constraint how deep the original tree can grow?
20:26:13 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Svetlana Yes, the max_depth of a Decision Tree is a hyperparameter we can set beforehand
20:26:16 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	@Diallo I think entropy is aimed to minimized when the model is ran every time. But the model is good enough is still deepening on the performance to be compared with training vs test
20:26:31 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Can you review the concept of “misclassification”?
20:26:41 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	how is the outcome evaluated when we aggregate the leafs into a node?
20:26:43 From  Diallo Bocar Elimane gl  to  Everyone:
	Thnaks
20:27:11 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	@Svetlana I think we can set max_depth in the parameter
20:27:35 From  [GL-TA] Maruthi Reddy  to  Everyone:
	@Natalia Q:What is easier to fix or what is worst to have? Variance or bias?		A:Bias and variance are complements of each other” The increase of one will result in the decrease of the other and vice versa. Hence, we need to find the right balance of values.
20:27:46 From  Nageswara Rao Biradhar gl  to  Everyone:
	@Maruthi - Thanks. Only difference I see is there is no compensatory term introduced in Pruning when compared to Lasso. we just lose some information in Pruning right?
20:28:01 From  Sarah Ford gl  to  Everyone:
	What are some typical heuristics to decide whether pruning is beneficial?
20:28:14 From  [GL-TA] Maruthi Reddy  to  Everyone:
	@Nageswara yes you are right.
20:28:16 From  Paula Iglesias Otárola gl  to  Everyone:
	@Diallo, entropy max value depends on how many values can Y take (for 2 Max E is 1, but for more Y leves it is a different, higher, value)… so "reasonable" dependes on each problem
20:29:03 From  Diallo Bocar Elimane gl  to  Everyone:
	Thanks Paula
20:29:35 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	That means if the data has a pattern the higher fitting may actually work right ?
20:30:25 From  Svetlana Vo gl  to  Everyone:
	thank you!
20:30:53 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	When we look at a tree and try to get some conclusions, what kind of entropy value will be ‘good enough’ to make sense? 0.5 or less?
20:31:27 From  [GL-TA] Akash  to  Everyone:
	@Sarah Q:What are some typical heuristics to decide whether pruning is beneficial? 
	A: A common strategy is to grow the tree until each node contains a small number of instances then use pruning to remove nodes that do not provide additional information. Pruning should reduce the size of a learning tree without reducing predictive accuracy as measured by a cross-validation set.
20:36:07 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	About entropy and the greedy algorithm in Decision Trees, In game theory, by example, chess heuristics, navigate 3 or 4 levels deep in the tree before taking the decision of which "move" to do. Wondering if Decision Tree models are using a similar approach like comparing the entropy 2 or 3 levels deep before taking the decision to split the tree for a specific feature/condition.
20:37:41 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	@Wilberto the latest layer. So that’s why it’s locally optimal, but not guarantee the global optimal
20:38:24 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	Is it possible that some times when you prune -you "graft" part of the pruned sub- tree to the upper part of the tree further up-stream?
20:38:52 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	yes is the local in 2 layers then you keep doing the same in next level, like next "move"
20:42:02 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	What is RVs?
20:42:06 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	@Sunil I guess not since if it’s homogenius, the branch won’t go further. So pruning is supposedly be one layer only, but not keep upstream
20:42:11 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	RV = Random variable
20:42:13 From  Jesus Chavez gl  to  Everyone:
	random variables?
20:42:26 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	ah thanks Alvin
20:42:59 From  [GL-TA] Maruthi Reddy  to  Everyone:
	@ Wilberto- Q: Wondering if Decision Tree models are using a similar approach like comparing the entropy 2 or 3 levels deep before taking the decision to split the tree for a specific feature/condition.		A: No, Decision Trees compares entropy of only 1 level at a time before taking a decision to split.
20:43:34 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	thanks
20:47:48 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	why test data has different size?
20:47:55 From  MAHZABEEN RAHMAN gl  to  Everyone:
	What is meant by “Datasets are correlated” for bootstrapping?
20:48:08 From  Jesus Chavez gl  to  Everyone:
	Boostraps can repeat samples?
20:48:25 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	@wilberto: was by chance, the test set contains what was not selected in the bootstrap set
20:48:25 From  John Rogers gl  to  Everyone:
	So test sets are created by that which has been left out at random?
20:48:32 From  Dayna Levy gl  to  Everyone:
	but that weights some samples more over others
20:48:33 From  Govinda Villasa Lopez Garza gl  to  Everyone:
	Are they random?
20:49:05 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	Ok professor answered my question
20:49:20 From  Svetlana Vo gl  to  Everyone:
	similar to Jesus's question, what's the benefit of including same observation twice in a bootstrap sample?
20:49:25 From  [GL-TA] Ajith  to  Everyone:
	@Jesus - Q: Boostraps can repeat samples?		A: Yes. The samples can be repeated
20:49:49 From  [GL-TA] Jai  to  Everyone:
	@Jesus, The bootstrap method involves iteratively resampling a dataset with replacement. It can be repeated.
20:49:51 From  Great Learning  to  Hosts and panelists:
	@Wilberto Q: why test data has different size?	A: The model uses the rules learned from the training data to predict the test data. So we take the large portion of the original data as the training data and a small portion (usually 30% or 20%) as the test data
20:50:31 From  Jesus Chavez gl  to  Everyone:
	ok thanks
20:51:09 From  Great Learning  to  Hosts and panelists:
	@John - Yes
20:51:59 From  Mohammad Nazif Faqiry gl  to  Everyone:
	How does the number of bootstrapping play in this limit/probability?
20:53:05 From  Great Learning  to  Hosts and panelists:
	@Svetlana Q: What's the benefit of including same observation twice in a bootstrap sample?	A: It is to make the samples, and consequently classifiers, as independent as they can be
20:53:15 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	is there a good way to pick “n” so samples are not too dependent?
20:54:05 From  Nageswara Rao Biradhar gl  to  Everyone:
	How’s does f(x) looks like for a decision tree
20:55:16 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	@Nageswara Rao Biradhar  -refer to previous lecture notes where the map f(x_i) -> Y represents a DT
20:57:37 From  Kuldeep Rawat gl  to  Everyone:
	Can we eliminate a particular DT with a higher classification error (over a certain threshold) and not consider its vote at the aggregation stage?
21:03:35 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	can we sample without replacement in large dataset?
21:04:20 From  Robert D. Hill gl  to  Everyone:
	is it possible to do a poor job of bootstrapping? if so, how?
21:04:24 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	i think the professor is using boosting and bootstrapping interchangeable?
21:04:28 From  Jose Daniel Cols Matheus gl  to  Everyone:
	Can we use bagging with different classifier algorithms, e.g. K-NN + Decision Trees?
21:04:36 From  Robert D. Hill gl  to  Everyone:
	or stated differently...how do you make sure you use a good job of bootstrapping?
21:05:08 From  Robert D. Hill gl  to  Everyone:
	*do not use
21:07:00 From  Diljot Chhina gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	is loss of 0 considered a good result?
21:07:34 From  Svetlana Vo gl  to  Everyone:
	do all samples in bootstrapping have to have the same size, and if not, do they get different vote weights?
21:08:27 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	@Robert I guess the reason why you want to aggregate because you want to eliminate the worry you think the boos-trapping does not do a good job.
21:08:35 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Hosts and panelists:
	@Svetlana - Yes, they do have the sample size
21:09:12 From  [GL-TA] Avijit  to  Everyone:
	@Jose   -Q:Can we use bagging with different classifier algorithms, e.g. K-NN + Decision Trees?	A:Bagging is rarely used with KNN. But we use bagging in decision tree when our goal is to reduce variance of the tree.
21:11:06 From  Dayna Levy gl  to  Everyone:
	which ones are getting a 1 and which ones are getting a 0?
21:11:34 From  Jose Daniel Cols Matheus gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Thank you, Avijit.
21:11:39 From  Pornthip Suyasith gl  to  Everyone:
	Why x1 is French and it goes to 1 ?
21:11:55 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	Fliped a coin
21:12:05 From  John Rogers gl  to  Everyone:
	@Dayna it is coming from the data set, 1 = wait and 0 = leave
21:12:18 From  Dayna Levy gl  to  Everyone:
	so it could be 1=leave and 0=wait?
21:12:20 From  Michael Allerheiligen gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	How do you choose the amount of bootstrap samples to utilize?
21:12:21 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	can be 0 or 1 because the category is not in the training data for that model
21:12:21 From  Robert Gormley gl  to  Everyone:
	What about result on test sets
21:13:21 From  MAHZABEEN RAHMAN gl  to  Everyone:
	How to you the subset of the features? Randomly?
21:14:02 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	you subset that data and the tree chooses the features by entropy
21:14:34 From  Nageswara Rao Biradhar gl  to  Everyone:
	Each classifier is selected based on the error < 0.5 out of the possible sub tree decisions within each classifier?
21:15:04 From  Mohammad Nazif Faqiry gl  to  Everyone:
	Seems like letting an army (of small trees) do the job of  a superman (the big tree)
21:15:30 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	is simplicity key in these models? would maximizing each model and weighing averages be better?
21:16:07 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	like the quote "data is Data", Data Rules 😉
21:16:22 From  Arnold Estrada gl  to  Everyone:
	Why cant we have army of supermen?  In other words, can we use trees of greater complexity than one layer with this same bagging idea?
21:16:41 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	@Wilberto great quote! 🙂
21:17:34 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Hosts and panelists:
	@Chris - Yes, the idea is to use simple classifiers that are not expensive computationally and get an ensemble model that is better than those individual weak learners
21:17:42 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	@Nageswra, I think <0.5 is the assumption of voting If it goes > 0.5, the result is even worse
21:17:50 From  Stephanie Hurtado Lonard gl  to  Everyone:
	did it freeze for everyone or just me?
21:18:01 From  Arnold Estrada gl  to  Everyone:
	didnt free for me
21:18:05 From  Sarah Ford gl  to  Everyone:
	What is the intuition behind assuming bootstrapped samples are completely independent?
21:18:06 From  Arnold Estrada gl  to  Everyone:
	freeze*
21:18:07 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Stephanie I think it may be just you. Can you try rejoining?
21:18:17 From  Stephanie Hurtado Lonard gl  to  Everyone:
	ok now its back
21:18:20 From  Maristela Monteiro gl  to  Everyone:
	I am on random forest Part III
21:18:43 From  Chelsea La Bella gl  to  Everyone:
	he is answering questions before moving on you should see random forest part III on screen
21:19:02 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	Can we do "model pruning" eliminating the models that perform worst in test data?
21:19:20 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	I mean in the aggregation
21:19:25 From  Stephanie Hurtado Lonard gl  to  Everyone:
	all good now, thank you all!
21:19:45 From  Saradha Ravi gl  to  Everyone:
	that is powerful!
21:20:44 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	we have not lost the tree- we have just gained a forest right? (just making sure I don't get tripped on the quiz)
21:20:48 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	I remember the famous Netflix Prize winner used assemble too.
21:21:44 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Hosts and panelists:
	@Sunil - Yes. Losing the tree means that we have lost the interpretability of the model.
21:23:55 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Sunil - Yes. Losing the tree means that we have lost the interpretability of the model.
21:24:19 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	Thanks Prateek D
21:25:26 From  HARIISH UPPILI gl  to  Everyone:
	Does order matter atleast to ensure random forest produces meaningful classifications ?
21:25:27 From  Arnold Estrada gl  to  Everyone:
	so its like bagging across samples, rather than samples?
21:25:50 From  Arnold Estrada gl  to  Everyone:
	sorry.  Its like bagging across features, rather than samples
21:25:53 From  Arnold Estrada gl  to  Everyone:
	?
21:27:19 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Harish - No, the order does not matter because each classifier is considered with equal importance
21:28:53 From  Erika Spangler gl  to  Everyone:
	What situations would lead you to use a random forest?
21:30:43 From  Lorae Westmarsh gl  to  Everyone:
	That would help overcome greedy tendencies
21:31:07 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Does this “level 6” include the root node?
21:31:36 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	@Arnold yes, I understand it so, but without repetition
21:31:57 From  Robert Gormley gl  to  Everyone:
	What constitutes the test set when using RF
21:31:58 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Chris - Yes
21:32:27 From  Svetlana Vo gl  to  Everyone:
	can you give some examples where random forests vs random walk is the preferred approach?
21:34:14 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	how do you calculate correlations among classifiers?
21:39:07 From  Sarah Ford gl  to  Everyone:
	Are RF/CART valid even if the assumption of independence between bootstrapped samples is violated?
21:39:37 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Could we use a Logistic regression?
21:40:13 From  Kuldeep Rawat gl  to  Everyone:
	How do we determine correlation between each classifier?
21:40:26 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	is x a vector of features?
21:41:20 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	@Rodrigo I think Logistic can be overkill, because the non-linearity is being handled by the Tree
21:42:03 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Sarah Q: Are RF/CART valid even if the assumption of independence between bootstrapped samples is violated?	A: If you are using the bootstrapped samples, then the assumptions will not be violated.
21:42:10 From  Saradha Ravi gl  to  Everyone:
	how is final value determined in Regression trees
21:42:26 From  Saradha Ravi gl  to  Everyone:
	like in the place of majority vote in categorical
21:42:55 From  Saradha Ravi gl  to  Everyone:
	sorry in classification label I mean
21:43:47 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	bewutiful=so you will create a set of tangents to the ellipse!
21:44:06 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Rodrigo Q: Could we use a Logistic regression?	A: Yes, you can do any classifier while training a bagging classifier but the performance will depend on the data. On the other hand, Random Forests can only use decision tress as base classifiers
21:45:56 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	how the classification works when the outcome is categorical variable with more than 2 values? voting?
21:47:21 From  [GL-TA] Prateek Dhokwal  to  Everyone:
	@Fernando - Yes, Voting works In multi-class classification as well.
21:48:38 From  MAHZABEEN RAHMAN gl  to  Everyone:
