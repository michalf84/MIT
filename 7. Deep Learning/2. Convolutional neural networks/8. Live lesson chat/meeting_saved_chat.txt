20:16:20 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Chris
	Q:how well could this identify abnormalities on an image? for instance a how many mugs have a stain on them?
	A: For that you have to create a dataset which would have clean mugs and stained mugs. and they should be labelled appropriately
20:18:02 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	could that be utilized to find something new? discoloration, imperfections, without having pre trained it to look for specifics simply by saying this isn't like the others?
20:19:34 From  Al Ganeshkumar gl  to  Everyone:
	How does it handle it if the box only covers partial handle?
20:19:47 From  Shan Siddiqui gl  to  Everyone:
	Does the image format of the mug make a difference? For example, RAW images have much more data in them than simple JPEG images?
20:20:05 From  Suresh Prathipati gl  to  Everyone:
	How do we know the number for handle/jar etc?
20:20:12 From  Prerna Mathur gl  to  Everyone:
	How does it handle multiple images
20:20:27 From  Eduardo Brandao de Souza Mendes gl  to  Everyone:
	what if our cup is huge in the image and no detector alone can detect the 'big picture'?
20:21:21 From  Rajagopalan Kasthurirangan gl  to  Everyone:
	How would it handle if one mug is front of another? Like the image of the cheetah that was in one of the previous slides. It had detected 3 cheetah.
20:22:25 From  Dayna Levy gl  to  Everyone:
	it actually looks like it would also detect a mask as a mug
20:23:20 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Shan
	Q:Does the image format of the mug make a difference? For example, RAW images have much more data in them than simple JPEG images?
	A:That's a very good question. yes it can be the case that an image present on the surface of the mug might also be a viable object of interest in prediction
20:23:27 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	what is the least amount and max amount of filters on average that we see to achieve image recognition?
20:24:15 From  Al Ganeshkumar gl  to  Everyone:
	what is relu
20:24:17 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	Ok that was the reason professor mentioned to drop last layer, those are the ones that do classification...
20:24:27 From  Sergio Bracho Argotte gl  to  Everyone:
	Does CNN always use RELU activation?
20:24:31 From  Victor Chavarria gl  to  Everyone:
	this looks like layers of photoshop, very cool
20:24:34 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	on Monday I mean
20:25:31 From  Suresh Prathipati gl  to  Everyone:
	How do we detect? How do I know the number belongs to handle etc?
20:25:35 From  Brandi Bax gl  to  Everyone:
	The layers slide is *chef's kiss*
20:25:56 From  Mike Hankinson gl  to  Everyone:
	@Al. RELU is one type of activation function....see slides from Monday.
20:26:06 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Eduardo,
	Q:what if our cup is huge in the image and no detector alone can detect the 'big picture'?
	A: If it's big enough, it will still be handled by detectors because of functions like Maxpooling, average pooling that you'll learn along the course of this lecture. They usually break down an image from higher size to lower, capturing only important features
20:26:09 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	what about the sizes of sliding windows and pictures? Do you set pictures to same size or do you set the sliding window relative to the image?
20:26:48 From  Steven Rubio gl  to  Everyone:
	Can we quantify a 3D shape of a cup and apply the common denominator (in shapes) to the images we're trying to observe?
20:26:54 From  [GL-TA] Avijit  to  Everyone:
	@Lucy Q:what is the least amount and max amount of filters on average that we see to achieve image recognition?		A:There is no correct answer as to what the best number of filters is. This strongly depends on the type and complexity of your (image) data. A suitable number of features is learned from experience after working with similar types of datasets repeatedly over time. In general, the more features you want to capture (and are potentially available) in an image the higher the number of filters required in a CNN.
20:27:42 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	These filters are NOT provided to the NN but is actually the NN that finds the filters by training, isn't it?
20:27:54 From  Mukul Mondal gl  to  Everyone:
	Here we are capturing data from all the area, so how do we know, which all part to combine?
20:28:03 From  Hongbin Liu gl  to  Everyone:
	Dot product is some projection + scaling. What would be intuition behind dot product help to manifest “features”
20:28:07 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	can we check the filters found after training?
20:28:19 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Wilberto The size of the filters is a hyperparameter, but the values in those filters are learned by the neural network.
20:28:37 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	Avijit- Thank you
20:28:39 From  Jian Yang gl  to  Everyone:
	What information is left after a filtering?  an array or a number?
20:28:54 From  Kalpana Singh gl  to  Everyone:
	what is I put handle on one side of cup but in some picture It is on other side
20:29:00 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Everyone:
	Found this on Machine Learning blog:
20:29:04 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Everyone:
	What is the difference between pooling and convolution?
	Convolutional layers in a convolutional neural network summarize the presence of features in an input image. ... Pooling layers provide an approach to down sampling feature maps by summarizing the presence of features in patches of the feature map.
20:30:04 From  Hongbin Liu gl  to  Everyone:
	Are filters initialized with random numbers?
20:30:11 From  Mohammad Nazif Faqiry gl  to  Everyone:
	How do you decide the size of the patch and what numbers in the patch?
20:30:37 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Sergio
	Q:Does CNN always use RELU activation?
	A: No, CNNs use a variety of activation functions along side ReLu ofcourse. The simple reason being no pixels can have negative value
20:30:56 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	Do  the patches overlap i.e. the blue and red squares, or does it take each pixel 1 by 1?
20:31:36 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	Ithink each pixel is a vector with the 3 colors
20:31:50 From  Sergio Bracho Argotte gl  to  Everyone:
	This reminds me the kids movie "The Mitchells vs the machines", were the robots collapse trying to identify if its a pug, a pig or bread
20:32:30 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Mohammad,
	Q:How do you decide the size of the patch and what numbers in the patch?
	A:If you're referring to filters, we decide the size of it by a little domain knowledge. usually we pick the common sizes. However the numbers , those are learnt over time by the process of training
20:33:12 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Wilberto, yes. 
	also alternately , each colour channel is a 2-D vector
20:34:18 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Hongbin
	Q:Are filters initialized with random numbers?
	A: Yes, great thinking. They are random numbers first and later they learn through the training process
20:34:31 From  [GL-TA] Avijit  to  Everyone:
	@Hongbin Q:Are filters initialized with random numbers?	A:Typically, filter values in CNN are initialized randomly in a normal distribution or other distributions. Later on, a machine fine tunes these values during training.
20:35:04 From  John Rogers gl  to  Everyone:
	010
20:35:10 From  Sergio Bracho Argotte gl  to  Everyone:
	0 1 0
20:36:17 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Everyone:
	Couldn’t the “after convolution” value be 3 if the inputs & weights are both 1?
20:36:58 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	Pixel colour are only positive values
20:36:59 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Jian,
	Q:What information is left after a filtering?  an array or a number?
	A:At the start of the training, the filters are unable to extract any information. But with time, some filters get modified to identify horizontal edges, some vertical edges, some darker areas, some lighter areas. so a series of filters are responsible for identifying features like maybe an eyebrow, or maybe the handle of a mug.
20:37:06 From  Hongbin Liu gl  to  Everyone:
	If the size of filter is hyper parameter, what does the big or the small size mean? Big -> more blur  less distinct ?
20:38:41 From  Victor Chavarria gl  to  Everyone:
	if we have 100 parameters, do we still have a single digit after convolution?
20:39:11 From  Victor Chavarria gl  to  Everyone:
	w’s are the parameters, correct?
20:40:00 From  Mike Hankinson gl  to  Everyone:

20:43:01 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	So the padding is half the size of you filter
20:43:59 From  Will McGuire gl  to  Everyone:
	is there a function for determining optimum stride?
20:44:03 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Victor,
	Q:if we have 100 parameters, do we still have a single digit after convolution?
	A:Yes for a full filter, there is a single result of the convolution
20:44:21 From  Victor Chavarria gl  to  Everyone:
	thanks
20:45:12 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	what is the significance in stride # in the final output? i.e. 2 v 3 v 4 strides?
20:46:47 From  Ravi Kumar gl  to  Everyone:
	How Filter size is selected? At the end of the filtering, last rows will always be zeroes and are there any chances of misinterpretation?
20:48:07 From  Steven Rubio gl  to  Everyone:
	Is it useful to apply an effect to the images to sharpen our visual on the edges and then run our logic by 4x4 pixels?
20:48:11 From  Sarah Yang gl  to  Everyone:
	Is there any trainings involved in creating Filters?
20:48:24 From  Sergio Bracho Argotte gl  to  Everyone:
	Can I change the size of the filter?
20:48:45 From  Lucy Edosomwan gl  to  Everyone:
	Thank you
20:52:21 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	So every time we apply a filter we "loss" some information, limiting the capacity of the NN to learn from the missed data
20:52:28 From  Victor Chavarria gl  to  Everyone:
	it seems like instagram is using us as training data for Meta’s neuro network. and we are all happy aplying filters to our pictures… not a question, just an observation
20:54:06 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Wilberto Yes, that's why the role of convolutions and pooling is important - they try to retain only the information from the image we really need, and forget the rest of the information. For example, to detect a duck in an image, the color of the sky above the lake is not really important.
20:54:49 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	thanks Vishnu
20:56:36 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	in this example we could have done a filter that contains the square directly no?
20:57:37 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	@fernando, yes but it will tied to the 3X3 square size the edge approach is valid for any size square
20:59:22 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	how would that work without the white space in the middle of this one?
20:59:58 From  Erika Spangler gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Quick nomenclature question: Does layer 1 have 2 channels? What is a channel?
21:00:38 From  Erika Spangler gl  to  Everyone:

21:00:43 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	thanks @wilberto and @professor
21:01:00 From  Deepak Gaikwad gl  to  Everyone:
	Is the horizontal edge filter is detecting based on white horizontal squares or the black horizontal squares?
21:01:03 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Everyone:
	does the CNN automatically learn the final “shapes” through labels in the training data?
21:01:14 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Deepak Black horizontal squares
21:01:32 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	Are all these learnt automatically and we are trying to interpret the process here, please?
21:02:31 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	Or how much is needed from the human design?
21:03:35 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	That is the question. How do you pass this ‘hidden box’ learnt strategy to others?
21:03:45 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Thanh
	Q:does the CNN automatically learn the final “shapes” through labels in the training data?
	A:The shapes of Convolutional filters are given by the programmer only, but the weights are modified during training
21:06:04 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Ning Yes, in the next lecture, we will cover the idea of "Transfer Learning" where the initial learnt weights from one model trained on one task can be used for another similar task as well, because the initial logic around detecting edges and simple shapes and patterns is common to many image classification tasks
21:06:37 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	Is there addition learning if it is not horizontal or vertical? Say it is 30 degree tilted cup? Or it is the same?
21:07:39 From  Omar Fahmy gl  to  Everyone:
	Are there other pooling functions? This is ma
21:07:50 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Ning So far, the convolution operation and filtering has not been "rotationally invariant", and that can be a problem for such neural networks. The process to make such models more robust to rotation is coming later in this session :)
21:08:22 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	thx
21:08:38 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Omar Yes - there are a few schemes for pooling. Max/min pooling and average pooling are two common ones.
21:08:44 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	Can you ‘spin’ the imagine first before processing?
21:08:53 From  Omar Fahmy gl  to  Everyone:
	Thanks Vishnu
21:12:16 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	So you can come into the ‘hidden box’ to engineer the network, please?
21:12:41 From  Deepak Gaikwad gl  to  Everyone:
	what were the scores on the top of the bars on Deep CNN slide?
21:13:20 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Deepak The misclassification rate, or the errors. The errors of the best models on ImageNet have been decreasing (or the models have been getting better accuracies) the deeper the network.
21:14:54 From  Lex Gidley gl  to  Everyone:
	Sorry, I missed this, what "connections" does ResNet skip?
21:17:58 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Lex Essentially the 'x' (input) skips a layer and goes straight to the second layer to contribute to its computing, in addition to going through the first layer. So the input for the second layer is not just F(x), but F(x) + x.
21:18:39 From  Lex Gidley gl  to  Everyone:
	Vishnu - thank you
21:19:52 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	Are there databases of well developed detectors that people can plug in and use?

21:29:58 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Everyone:
	Performance would drop
21:30:09 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Everyone:
	Or take longer to train
21:30:13 From  Suresh Prathipati gl  to  Everyone:

21:30:20 From  Mukul Mondal gl  to  Everyone:
	same
21:30:28 From  Maurice Edwards gl  to  Everyone:
	I think the rotation matters - the representation wouldn't match
21:30:30 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Everyone:
	would be similar bc of the pooling
21:30:32 From  Reto Voegeli gl  to  Everyone:
	same
21:30:35 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	very good detection I would guess
21:30:41 From  Steven Rubio gl  to  Everyone:
	the matrix will have to rotate too, so the performance will drop.
21:30:50 From  Victor Chavarria gl  to  Everyone:
	eigen vector and value use?
21:31:57 From  Raji Kandan gl  to  Everyone:
	strides for filters? horizontal/vertical movement may not be enough??
21:32:18 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	why does it struggle so much with the dog? detail?
21:32:39 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	self-symmetry
21:32:40 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Everyone:
	Is this graph during the training process or afterwards (after the model has been trained?
21:32:42 From  Maurice Edwards gl  to  Everyone:
	heh -  I struggled with the dog!
21:32:58 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	Maurice your NN needs rotational invariance
21:33:14 From  Steven Rubio gl  to  Everyone:
	haha
21:33:21 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Chris This is after the training, it's already been trained, and we're testing it on rotated images

	For more complex images, how do you know what features NN use to train on? Is this "explainability". Can you touch on that and explain it?
21:50:06 From  Will McGuire gl  to  Everyone:
	could an overlay like that be used to hide images from a search?
21:52:07 From  Will McGuire gl  to  Everyone:

21:52:36 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	What tools do we use to debug NN?
21:52:54 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	Did we solve the Car-feature problem- I missed the thread of thought
21:53:41 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	@Sunil by augmenting the data, cropping images for example, would force the model to learn something different
21:54:28 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	 @Sunil Yes, to prevent the neural network from wrongly associating cars with the presence of a sky, give it images of cars without a sky as well, for example.
21:54:29 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	@Fernando- but the size of the convolution filter already kind of does it..
21:55:28 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	Is there a way to highlight what inside an image you would like to learn?
21:55:33 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	Is there a way to output how the network learnt after the training?
21:56:35 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	you can get the weights vector if that helps
21:56:55 From  Nikhil Kamma gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Vishnu, how is the data file prepared, in the project for digits we have an h5 file, but wondering in our real world, how do we do data preparation, prepare files like h5
21:57:02 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	in case where you can have intuitions based upon it
21:57:32 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	however other than that, you can plot out the training errors versus epochs. like how the errors reduced over time.
21:58:22 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	thanks
21:58:56 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	Does object detection when we provide the coordinates could help to avoid taking wrong data?
21:58:58 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	For example is it the location or the shape?
21:59:07 From  NING LI gl  to  Everyone:
	Other than testing it, can we see it?

22:00:53 From  My Coyne gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Many (if not all) applications for CNN, FNN, and Deep Learning are for computer vision.  Indeed Vision and Image Processing advanced  so much.  I would like to ask what other applications that applies CNN or Neural Networks, in general.  Any examples on detecting the nuance in the language?  Or nuance on the people facial expression?
22:00:55 From  Jacqueline gl  to  Everyone:
	Thank you so much professor!
22:01:02 From  Mukul Mondal gl  to  Everyone:

22:02:27 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	Can you comment on the Captcha problem if you have some time? (eg: Why are they so difficult if letter recognition is easy otherwise)
22:02:32 From  Mukul Mondal gl  to  Everyone:
	Can you apply CNN on time series data / dynamic data
22:03:34 From  Saradha Ravi gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Can they be used with bag of words model in text corpora?
22:03:45 From  Cheslan Simpson gl  to  Everyone:
	Jumping ahead here. What are the latest tools for image recognition? I hear about transformers. What are those?
22:04:01 From  LINGFEI LI (FIONN) gl  to  Everyone:
	Would CNN do good job on scanning and detecting cancer cells?
22:04:04 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	So CNN trained on photographic image won't appreciate cubism for a while.. what a pitty
22:04:36 From  Chao Sun gl  to  Everyone:
	Is ResNet only a enhanced model for CNN or it can also applied to uses case that's not image recognition etc?
22:08:13 From  [GL-TA] Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	Hi Chao, it usually caters to image recognition tasks only
22:12:03 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	Can you apply CNN to more of a "continuous variable" data?
22:12:51 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	Not necessarily regression
22:14:24 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	You have all these "gradients" and "differential" operators in the learning algorithm -I am puzzled how it works for discrete daa
22:14:25 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:

	misremembering- now that is a great word
22:16:53 From  Hongbin Liu gl  to  Everyone:
	I am trying to get some math intuition behind filter. Dot product is projection and scaling; how projection and scaling can help with capture “features” or things like edges ?
22:18:45 From  Mukul Mondal gl  to  Everyone:
	Within neural network, how do you handle things like: Happy face, Sad Face, exciting face, speaking face. I mean, there could be unlimited number of combination of  an image
22:19:54 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	To move from image to video recognition, how does CNN fair in this field - say detecting a specific motion -is CNN has the speed to do this to be of practical use?
22:20:02 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	does CNN..
22:21:34 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Mukul There's an interesting dataset called fer2013 on Kaggle - neural networks have been applied to facial emotion detection on that dataset :)
22:23:06 From  Sunil Acharya gl  to  Everyone:
	@Mukul smiling/frowning can be classified as geometric transformations..
22:24:52 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
