20:10:22 From  Omar Fahmy gl  to  Everyone:
	How many layers do you build on top of the pre-trained NN
20:10:57 From  [GL-TA]Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Omar
	Q:How many layers do you build on top of the pre-trained NN
	A:It's totally subjective and dependent on the task in hand
20:11:34 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Omar Usually, only a few. For deep models, the majority of the layers are the pre-trained portion whose weights are frozen.
20:11:57 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	Could I say that I am replacing a random initialization of the weigths for another that was created from the same domain (e.g images, text,etc)?
20:12:16 From  Ahsan Yousaf gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	does pre training has to be on medical images or can be on any image if the end objective is to spot tumors ?
20:12:24 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	@Omar I think the idea is to keep al CNN layes and just modify part or all the fully connected last layers
20:13:05 From  Omar Fahmy gl  to  Everyone:
	Thanks all@! 😄
20:14:37 From  Rajagopalan Kasthurirangan gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Are there precompile models for tasks like the imagenet?
20:15:11 From  [GL-TA] Jai  to  Everyone:
	@Ahsan-Q:does pre training has to be on medical images or can be on any image if the end objective is to spot tumors ?
	A: If your end goal is spotting tumors, it should be trained on medical images specific to tumors to achieve promising results.
20:15:43 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Rodrigo Yes, that would be a fair takeaway
20:16:26 From  Dr Vincent Grek gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	So it is possible to label automatically… magic…
20:16:30 From  [GL-TA]Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Ahsan
	Q:does pre training has to be on medical images or can be on any image if the end objective is to spot tumors ?
	A: It can be on any task that is classification. For example if you have a dog-cat classifier, you can set a few layers as non trainable and add or train a layers on the existing model and use it for medical image classification tasks
20:16:40 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Rajagopalan Yes, there are several famous architectures like VGG16 already available out of the box in TensorFlow / Keras
20:17:16 From  Dr Vincent Grek gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	…. Wouaaaa…..
20:18:11 From  Ahsan Yousaf gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Are generative models same as CNN  ?
20:18:13 From  Asmaa Soliman AbuMaziad gl  to  Everyone:
	Hi, I need help in Python practice, can anyone volunteer an hour via Zoom (plz contact: asmaa@peds.arizona.edu)
20:18:21 From  [GL-TA] Jai  to  Everyone:
	@Rajagopalan- Q:Are there precompile models for tasks like the imagenet?
	A: Yes, we have many pre-trained models like VGG,Resnet, Densenet etc that can work well on different kinds of datasets with appropriate tuning.
20:18:26 From  Yair Listokin gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	What are pretext tasks for text data?
20:19:12 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	would you want to run everything through a single neural network or can these be connected together
20:19:14 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	Any criteria or measurement that this model is transferable?
20:19:42 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	I still don't see where the labels are generated
20:20:13 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	Enconder/decoder pattern like in translations
20:21:25 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	ok thanks
20:22:34 From  Omar Fahmy gl  to  Everyone:
	Are both of these examples considered generative learning?
20:22:50 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	I was expecting more of an automatic classification of different objects, being able to differentiate a dog from a cat by itself
20:23:12 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	How doe the model know that the training is accurate if there’s no base dataset that has labels?
20:23:20 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	is like training 2 model at same time
20:23:21 From  Chris Lieberman gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	There’s no reference point?
20:23:42 From  Dr Vincent Grek gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	When we have to indicate that we are not a robot through image identification, is it trick to have a free labeling of million of pictures?
20:24:21 From  Omar Fahmy gl  to  Everyone:
	Can’t hear the prof
20:24:21 From  Glendon Brown gl  to  Everyone:
	professor youre muted
20:24:24 From  [GL-TA] Jai  to  Everyone:
	@Alvin,Q:Any criteria or measurement that this model is transferable?
	A: Transfer Learning is simply transfering the weights of model to another model to complete the similar task.We can actually make every model transferable, main thumb rule is the model should atleast trained on huge datasets. So that the trained model is robust enough to work on similar datasets with proper tuning.
	 
20:25:00 From  Kalpana Singh gl  to  Everyone:
	Can we get an example of NLP here?
20:25:09 From  Ahsan Yousaf gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Once the model is trained to spot a tumor for example .. and then few weeks/days  later we have to train a model to spot cars .. why do we have to start from scratch .. wouldn’t that be a lost in resources ? Can’t the model keep evolving  like our brain does ..
20:25:12 From  Riaz U Ahmed gl  to  Everyone:

20:35:48 From  Adam Kritzman Frankel gl  to  Everyone:
	someone isn't on mute
20:37:03 From  Fernando Garcia Corona gl  to  Everyone:
	do you agument it after the initial classification has been done? or how can you tell that all the augmented dogs are the same?
20:37:54 From  Thanh Dang gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	is there a balance between positive pairs and negative pairs?
20:37:56 From  Abdelaziz Aitouchen gl  to  Everyone:
	what about images with low ontrast?c
20:38:19 From  Lex Gidley gl  to  Everyone:
	if we are starting from scratch how does it learn it is a "dog" beyond just saying "these are the same"?
20:39:05 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	how do you choose appropriate negatives?
20:39:29 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	Does the test data is also against un-label data or that one is labeled?
20:40:00 From  Lex Gidley gl  to  Everyone:
	ah - got it...thank you
20:43:10 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	So from greyscale to color drops the most
20:43:37 From  [GL-TA]Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Wilberto
	Q:how do you choose appropriate negatives?
	A:What you may do is, you may pick an image from a different class all total and take a cropped part from it or augment it any way you prefer.
20:44:14 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	Could we stack multiple pre-train models to make it a “super-smart” to do the transfer modeling?

20:48:36 From  [GL-TA]Debjyoti Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	@Alvin,
	Q:Could we stack multiple pre-train models to make it a “super-smart” to do the transfer modeling?
	A:That is a very interesting train of thought, you can definitely try it out
20:48:59 From  Alvin Kuo gl  to  Everyone:
	In Page 16 the chart of the negative samples, why do we see a pattern like this? https://www.dropbox.com/s/gl9nw8gch5hkfc1/WK5-3%20Page%2016%20Chart%20Pattern%20Screen%20Shot%202022-03-02%20at%2011.57.47%20PM.png?dl=0
20:49:06 From  Chris Kaiser gl  to  Everyone:
	like teaching a neural net to paint like Picasso?
20:49:27 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	is like CNN chess match with images (game theory)
20:49:56 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@Sivakumar RNNs and their variants (LSTMs, GRUs) have been very useful in NLP over the last decade, but their performance on various language tasks have been eclipsed by even better ideas such as Transformers (attention mechanism) and Self-supervised Learning
20:52:37 From  [GL] Vishnu Subramanian  to  Everyone:
	@WIlberto It's interesting you say that. The generator and discriminator do compete with each other and may reach an equilibrium called the Nash Equilibrium, which is a well known idea from Game Theory :)
20:53:21 From  [GL-TA] Avijit  to  Everyone:
	@Sivakumar Q:Is RNN not the best method for NLP?		A:Transformers are currently the best model in the field of NLP. They are better than all the other architectures(like RNN, LSTM) because they totally avoid recursion, by processing sentences as a whole and by learning relationships between words because of the multi-head attention mechanisms and positional embeddings.
20:54:12 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	What is the input to the NN? Maybe the adjacency matrix that represents the graph? Is there a preferred encoding for the graph?
20:56:00 From  Dr Vincent Grek gl  to  Hosts and panelists:
	Eventually in my field…
21:01:37 From  Paula Iglesias Otárola gl  to  Everyone:

21:02:20 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	yes how do the navigation
21:02:30 From  Rodrigo Senra gl  to  Everyone:
	isn't  Local neighborhood just a way to scale down processing and avoid feeding the all-distances matrix as input?
21:02:40 From  Paula Iglesias Otárola gl  to  Everyone:
	the closest next node first for each node?
21:03:39 From  Wilberto W Montoya gl  to  Everyone:
	not good how avoid cycles and assure full search
